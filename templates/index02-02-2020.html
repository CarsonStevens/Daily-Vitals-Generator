              <p> Today, it's payback for you, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how many brownie points you've accrued in your karma account. If you worry that you're due for some bad news, try to keep busy! Staying distracted
                is the best way to soften whatever blows might be coming your way. But if you're confident that you've built up a lot of goodwill, then this is a great day to relax. Open up your schedule and enjoy having unstructured time to soak up
                all the good vibes.</p>

              <p> Try to avoid any financial dealings with your friends right now. No matter how exciting an opportunity may be, it's just not worth the risk when the health and happiness of a friendship could be at stake. There is a lot of
                uncertainty about transactions and investments right now, and you all would be much better off if you delayed moving forward with things. Wait for another time, when things are clearer. Money is a very personal issue. Don't make it a
                public one.</p>

            <section class="horoscope">
              <h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4>
              <p> If someone is critical about your work or attitude today, don't waste any time worrying about it. Unless they're saying things that will negatively affect your reputation and how others see you, you don't need to give a darn about
                what they think. But if you do start seeing that people are listening to this person and believing what they say, you must address the attacker immediately. People will think that if you don't fight back then what they're hearing must
                be true.</p>

              <p> You can't search for a ready-made new philosophy on life. You have to create one by exposing yourself to new ideas and theories. If you've been wrestling with a certain issue and just can't shake the bad way it's making you feel,
                seek some insight from friends. Ask them how they would handle things. Their answers will help you shape your own attitudes. What's right for them might not be right for you, but at least you're seeing different points of view, and
                that will be helpful.</p>

              <p> There are all sorts of creative ways to get around the conflicts in your life, but ignoring them sure isn't one of them! Procrastination will never, ever help you get things done. It will only keep you passive. Step up and take
                charge of your own life by having that conversation you've been dreading. Set some time aside later today and try to get face-to-face with the person who's causing you stress. If you can't do that, talk to them on the phone in a quiet
                location.</p>

              <h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4>
              <p> There is a huge risk of people overreacting today, so be careful about what you say to others, especially people you don't know very well. Even the slightest hint of something controversial could trigger someone's temper and get
                them all worked up and in your face. Who needs that? Plus, all of the excess energy they create will distract you from the things that really need your attention. Just carry on as you normally would. And keep an eye out for hotheads!

                being more flexible than you're willing to be. Everything you want to do, they will want to do, and vice versa. The tone of the day will be harmonious, and no one is going to be annoyed or out of sorts when you suggest your nuttiest
                idea.</p>

              <p> More than ever before, new music and art will spark your creativity today, offering you some new ideas and giving your brain a few new ways of thinking. Try to expose yourself to different music genres. When was the last time you
                listened to opera, Broadway tunes, or a little country? Click over to a music website and see what artists are similar to your favorites. If you have some money burning a hole in your pocket, invest in expanding your music collection.

              <p> Childlike behavior is only cute when it's taking place among children. If you see grownups acting like they're ten today, do yourself a favor and steer clear of them! And if you can't steer clear of them, at least refuse to join in
                on their silly games. You've got grownup business to attend to, and sitting around gossiping or cutting people down behind their back is not going to help you. People may think you're being a party pooper by not joining in, but do you
                really care?</p>

                who wants to be in charge today. You know you can do this, and you know you can do this well! You're only too glad to help, and there is no reason not to show it. Be enthusiastic and all of your doubts will just fade away.</p>

              <p> You might get sidetracked from one of your pressing projects by an unexpected relationship issue today, but it probably won't be a problem. Don't worry about the distraction. Deal with it. You can take care of it without alerting
                anyone at work or school to the fact that anything is amiss. You'll be back and focused on the task at hand without anyone being the wiser. In fact, you can expect a few compliments by the end of the day about what a great job you're
                doing!</p>

              <p> Your friends all come in different shapes, sizes, and styles, so don't treat them all the same way. It's not that you should play favorites; it's just that you should be mindful of the fact that some friends require more attention
                from you than others. Just because friend A doesn't need to hear from you for months, doesn't mean that friend B is going to be cool with that. Make sure you're giving everyone what they need. If you're not, it's not too late to start
                trying.</p>

                those favors that people owe you. There's bound to be a few up for grabs.</p>

                take it too far, you're going to set the precedent that you're always available. Not a good place to be when that needy client wants you and you're not around.</p>

              <p> That inner critic needs to be silenced. Sure, we all have things we could improve, but mentally taking note of your flaws all day long is detrimental to your well-being and self-confidence. Come up with some affirmations you can use
                to replace negative thoughts when they come up.</p>

              <p> Sometimes accidents or setbacks happen for a reason. They're supposed to teach us something valuable. Don't throw away the lesson if you've encountered something like this lately. What is the message here? Consider that delays or
                problems might actually be gifts in disguise. What can you learn from them?</p>

              <p> There are others out there who "get it," but maybe you haven't found them yet. Start looking for them today. Whether you're dying to date someone who shares your political views or want to connect with friends who love art as much
                as you do, be proactive about your search. Join online communities, get out of the house, and be the first to reach out.</p>

              <p> Don't dim your own light to make someone else feel secure. You have every right to shine and be your wonderful, talented self. If someone doesn't like it, too bad. Remember that saying, "I'm OK, you're OK"? Live by it. Know your
                worth, but don't think you're better than others. This is called self-love.</p>
