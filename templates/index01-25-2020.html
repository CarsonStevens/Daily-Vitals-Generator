His record was 6 minutes. A kid that was listening said, "that's nothing, I can stay under water for 10 minutes using no types of equipment or air pockets!" The magician told the kid if he could do that, he'd give him $10,000. The kid did it and won the money.

Whether you need to put the brakes on a new business project, cool off a blossoming romantic entanglement, or tell that pushy friend you need some time to yourself, the energy you put out today should be about reducing the level of commitment you have in your life. There is no sense in rushing ahead when you aren't totally sure where you're going.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> It's time to toot your own horn! If no one else is going to sing your praises today, you must step up to the microphone and belt it out! You deserve to feel pride in what you've done, because no one else could have done it as well. With every success comes a cloud of jealousy or anger from the folks who just couldn't pull it off. A few shining people will give you props, but you shouldn't rely on external approval for your sense of accomplishment. Give yourself a hand!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> There's a battle going on today between the high-spirited side and the quieter side of your personality. This is perfectly normal, and it will end in healthy self-realization. Be sure to give yourself time to work out these combative feelings, and don't expect to come to a certain conclusion anytime soon. This is something to mull over, not something to decide. Try to be comfortable with the state of flux you're in. It's stimulating some ideas.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> Someone else's business problems are not your problems, although you might have to deal with the fallout today (whether you like it or not). It's very important for you to separate this person from their problems, or you run the risk of getting distracted by emotional issues. Be careful not to get more involved than you need to be. The way you respond to things is your choice, and no one should be able to get away with questioning your motives.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> Major movements are happening in your life today, and just like shifting tectonic plates, these changes could create an earthquake. But instead of running for cover, you should head right out into the open so you can be the first person to take in the new landscape. New ideas are brewing just under the surface, and you are in a perfect frame of mind to nurture them and stick with them for the long haul. Wait for them to all come together into something real.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> You have a strong intuitive sense when it comes to what's going on within your group of friends, but you can't analyze the unseen. Today, find out what's driving their behavior. Just what are they so riled up about? Don't worry that they'll think you're interfering. They won't. In fact, they'll love having an objective ear as they vent about whatever it is that's getting them all excited. It will be fun for you to finally know what the deal is.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> Is money on your mind? If not, it should be. Things might be getting beyond your control, and you're in danger of getting lazy about keeping track of expenses. A little money here, a little money there, it all piles up faster than you can say "bankruptcy." Do yourself a favor and review your budget as soon as you can. You'll be amazed by the far-reaching effects some very small changes can make. It might also be time to revise your phone plan. There are deals to be had.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> An off-the-cuff comment will reveal a strong connection between you and someone else, and you'll know immediately that they have something you need. This could be something romantic, but it could also be professional. When you feel that satisfying emotional click today, you'll know that it's time to stay put and not go any further. What you've been waiting for is finally here, and there's no need to waste any more time looking for something better. For now, this is exactly what you need.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> There is simply no such thing as a free lunch in life, as wonderful as it would be if there were. Getting something for nothing just isn't possible, so be wary if someone approaches you with an offer you can't refuse today. Walk away from pressure tactics, and don't let the hard sell sway your steadfastness. If you're in the mood for something free, why not take a walk in a quiet, beautiful place? Public spaces can enable you to have some amazing private moments.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> The line between you and others is widening right now, because you're entering a phase of introspection. This is something to embrace, not be worried about. Even if your social life hasn't been extremely active lately, you will relish the discrepancy between what is going on in your own life and what is going on in the lives of others around you. This is your chance to step back from the world and bow out of social obligations. Get used to greater freedoms.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> Living on the fast track can be exciting and rewarding, but right about now it's time you slowed down your forward momentum. You can wait a few days to return those phone calls or e-mails. Why look so eager? Let the other people involved show their willingness to put forth some effort. You should be courted and pursued right now, not the other way around. You need to be reminded that you're a prize that is worth working for and winning.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> Your old habits have grown to become like a worn-out, dust-ridden blanket. Something that gives you comfort even though it might not be the best thing for you. You need to make sure that the blanket you cling to won't actually end up suffocating you. Today, take a look at the things you do in your life without really thinking and ask whether they're necessary or productive. If they are neither, it's time to get rid of them! Refocus on improving your health.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> You could be feeling a renewed sense of purpose. For those of you seeking a career change, this would be a good time to explore the possibilities. Your mental attitude maybe improving. Your lucky colors are yellow and green.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> You might have a shortage of funds in your bank account just when you were about to purchase that item you've had your eye on. On the social front, you could make a very valuable contact, so be friendly and do a lot of socializing today.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> An array of opportunities might show up at this time. The decision will probably be a hard one, driving you to seek counsel from friends. Doing so will likely only provoke their criticism, possibly out of jealousy for your embarrassment of riches. Focus on the option with the greatest long-term potential and go with it.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> Looks like you'll have to put in a full day's effort at home, because there could be many things piled on your plate today. Tonight, find an oasis with your family from your hectic day. If you're single, you could spend the evening curled up with your favorite novel.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> With today's influences, this could be your time to excel. Make sure there's at least one event on your social calendar. Active networking is how you can turn an otherwise average day into a good one.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> Expect the unexpected today. Good vibes at home could suddenly suffer the unwelcome intrusion of problems that nobody sees coming. Just as much of a shock, however, could be the arrival of assistance in overcoming these setbacks, so all is likely to end well.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> You seem to be in a relaxed and playful state of mind. Your day will be likely be filled with fun and laughter. This positive energy should reflect nicely regarding your finances and investments. All these stimulating activities should make time fly by in the blink of an eye.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> With a positive attitude fueled by plenty of exercise, you should be fit and healthy. Social life is favored today. Invite some new friends to dinner at home or at a favorite restaurant. Impressing people is a great way to gain networking connections. Your love relationship could suffer if you impose too many rules or too much order on your partner.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> The day should be full of promising prospects for those interested in fashion and design. New creative concepts flow through your mind like Niagara Falls. It's not a good idea to engage in risk and speculation when it comes to your long-term investments.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> You've got too much on your plate, forcing you to work more diligently than you have in a long time. To cope with the stress, try taking a few moments every few hours to relax your body and take deep, deliberate breaths. Your labor will bring dividends, earning you accolades and recognition.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Attempts to revitalize a flagging friendship could leave you weary and frustrated at this time. The exhaustion of pulling out your entire arsenal can be bad enough, but the feeling that you're losing a close friend could be devastating. Seek solace in the unconditional love of your family.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> Indirection might be the most effective method for resolving longstanding conflicts with family members. Together, try to focus on things you share and join forces to improve them. Enlisting the aid of a rebellious child in a DIY project, for example, can do wonders for your relationship.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4 class="grand" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h4><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>tribune, commit</li><li>noticeable, abnormal</li><li>secretive, apparent</li><li>franchise, bias</li><li>deceptive, adjoining</li><li>mindful, opposing</li><li>dress, cask</li><li>choose, accomplished</li><li>shelf, interview</li><li>impracticable, achievable</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>Year - Address - Scrap</li><li>Trains - Teapots - Referees</li><li>Statues - Turkeys - Initials</li><li>A Rooster - A Barber Shop - A Beehive</li><li>Pick-up - Fire - 4x4</li><li>Jump - Swim - Three Piece</li><li>McDonalds - St. Louis - A Foot</li><li>Mud - Pot - Coconut</li><li>Rock - Table - Epsom</li><li>New - Full - Cresent</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Aim Hiker Owes Cope</li><li>Aim Honey Bag Care Runt He</li><li>Aim Other Ranch Howled</li><li>Aim Us Key Tub Height</li><li>Aim Who Very Vi</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable8.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>tribute, contribute</li><li>apparent, aberrant</li><li>covert, overt</li><li>ballot, palate</li><li>ambiguous, contiguous</li><li>apprehensive, defensive</li><li>apparel, barrel</li><li>accept, adept</li><li>counter, encounter</li><li>impossible, possible</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Books</li><li>They have whistles</li><li>They're carved</li><li>They all have combs</li><li>Trucks</li><li>Suits</li><li>They all have arches</li><li>Pies</li><li>Salts</li><li>Moon</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>A Microscope</li><li>A Money Back Guarantee</li><li>A Mother and Child</li><li>A Mosquito Bite</li><li>A Movie Revie</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Last Dance</li><li>For Crying Out Loud</li><li>Inground Pool</li><li>No TV for a Week</li><li>High Frequency</li><li>Sit Ups</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>The kid filled a glass of water and held it over his head for 10 minutes.</p></section></section></body></html>
