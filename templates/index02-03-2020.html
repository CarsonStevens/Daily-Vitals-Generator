You have to put a cap on your wanderlust and stick close to home for now. Instead of being intrigued by new faces and new places, you have to learn to appreciate the known and familiar. Today offers you a wonderful opportunity to communicate your ideas with the people who really understand you. They can give you proper constructive criticism and help you build something that is meant to last.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> After weeks of going back and forth on some social plans, you'll reach a major turning point today when someone (not you) decides to give in and be more reasonable. This person has been going through a slow transformation, and you should be prepared to face some changes in the relationship. Certain truths are starting to become too obvious to ignore, so you'll have to stop ignoring them. Until you see things as they truly are, you can't move forward.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> There's a lot of power in groups, so you might find yourself wanting to be a part of a greater group in order to feel more powerful right now. But mob mentality is never a good thing. If you become a member of a group today, you need to make sure that you leave your mark. Whether you do so by being a vocal contributor to the agenda or by taking the initiative in the group dynamic is up to you. Just don't follow along without giving your input!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> Play interpreter to the feuding forces around you today and you'll enjoy many blessings, including a nice financial gain. Details that you know like the back of your hand are like ancient Greek to someone else. If you come to their aid and do some simple explaining, it will be a win/win situation. Gratitude gives people a good memory about you, and if you continue coming to people's aid today, you'll be reaping some huge rewards for a long time to come.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> Everything's been so entertaining lately, and the fun shows no sign of stopping any time soon! You and your friends can have a good time doing just about anything anywhere, so schedule some good deeds in with all that fun. Why not get a group together to clean up the block, work for a charity one afternoon, do some yardwork for a disabled neighbor, or hold a charity carwash? As long as you and your people are together, you'll be smiling!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> There is certainly no shortage of high-spirited energy inside you right now, but it will need a little bit of coaxing to come out at full strength. Why are you holding back? You should be all about celebrating the nuclear-strength power you have! Show people how it's possible to get tons of stuff done while still keep everyone happy. You're entering a highly productive phase, and this increased energy will help you create the momentum you need to carry you through.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> Are you taking enough time out of your day to appreciate the smaller things in life, or are you more obsessed with big, impressive material goods? It's important to remember that you can't fully appreciate the major things unless you can appreciate the minor ones, too. A stranger's smile, a little kid's giggle, or even just the beautiful clouds in the sky all deserve your notice. You run the risk of taking things for granted if you don't appreciate them more consciously.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> You'll have a hard choice to make today between feeding your mind and feeding your heart. Try to go for the option that feeds your intellect rather than your emotions. In the long run, you will gain more from learning than you ever could from getting a laugh, enjoying a flirtatious conversation, or relaxing with a friend. Move away from the instant gratification and realize that once you've fed your mind, you'll be much more able to enjoy what feeds your heart.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> Regardless of whether or not you're looking for a new romance right now, you'll have lots of fun meeting new people and flirting up a storm today. People will be flirting right back, too. And if you want more, you should encourage it. But if you don't, today is not a day to send mixed signals. You could be biting off more than you can chew. Be gentle and kind, but say what you really mean and tell them what you really want.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Dates and times are getting complicated, and not everyone's schedules are lining up together. People are going to be hard to get a hold of today, and one of your appointments might have to be rescheduled for another time. But don't fear that a postponement is going to derail progress. Moving things around on your calendar is necessary to keep them viable. If they need to reschedule, try to work with them. Being too rigid about things could scare them off.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> The cynical side of you comes out in full force today when someone's altruism sets off alarm bells in your mind. Before you cause a racket claiming that this person is full of ulterior motives, hold back. Wait and see how everyone else in the room reacts to this. Chances are they aren't going to see things the way you do. This doesn't mean you should change your mind. It just means you should wait for a more appropriate time to raise your concerns.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> You'll find yourself gravitating toward less conventional people and places today, and you'll have an absolute ball trying to figure them out. Ask these folks leading questions, and keep your ears wide open for hidden meaning. They're not going to make it easy for you to understand them, but they will sure make it fun to try and figure stuff out! Clues will be dropped left and right, and if you don't know them any more than you did yesterday, you won't mind.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand title" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> Your attempts to be generous could be falling flat. Does it feel like you just keep giving and giving without getting anything in return? Scale back on the selfless love today. It's one thing to offer support, but you don't have to bear the weight of the world on your shoulders.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> Do you feel like you're running out of steam lately? In all your attempts to be perfect, you might have burned out. Give the type-A habits a break today. You don't have to please everyone, and if you try, you could end up suffering even more than you already are. Chill. Do what you need to do to take care of you.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> A little family gathering or party could be just the thing you need to patch things up if there has been conflict around the house. Laughs, good times, and plenty of food could be the cure. Don't underestimate the power of quality time. It's something money can't buy.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> It may not be the best time to ask questions at work. Challenging authority could get you into hot water. The best approach? Lay low for now. The answers you're looking for will be revealed in time. If you act too eager right now, it could be perceived as being pushy and inappropriate.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> Stay away from disagreeable types today. If you're feeling positive and optimistic, don't let others drag you down. It's only going to slow your progress and make you second-guess yourself. If necessary, just work alone or shut yourself in your office until the storm clears.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> Be careful about spending money today. Some unexpected expenses may pop up soon and you'll want to have a nest egg ready. And don't lend any money in the next few weeks. People might be flaky about returning it. Take care of yourself and your own financial needs. Others will have to fend for themselves.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> Whatever it is you've been working on lately, take some time to admire how far you've come. Remember that it's progress, not perfection, that counts. If you don't take the time to praise yourself, you're never going to be satisfied no matter how much you accomplish. Give yourself a pat on the back.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> When addressing a problem today, you'll need to start from scratch. Attempting to rebuild what's broken will be much harder than just starting anew. Rethink your approach and do things differently this time. It's possible you'll come up with an inspired solution out of the blue, so keep your mind open to new ideas and possibilities.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> You might not be sure of your abilities, but you're going to have to take charge anyway. Better to step up and show you're willing to be a leader. People are watching you, so don't back down now. Have faith in yourself. You're more capable than you think.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> Try not to overanalyze things if people are acting a little critical today. Tempers might be flaring, but you'll need to keep your cool in order to get the most done. Keep your head down, stay focused, and try not to get in anyone's way. If you talk back to the wrong person, you might end up in the line of fire.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> A big change of plans could throw a monkey wrench in your day, but don't let it get you too far off track. If you just roll with the changes, you'll be in a much better frame of mind. Stay calm and composed and say yes to life. Keeping your stress level low will help you make much better decisions.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> Sometimes if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. Don't feel bad about stepping up and taking over a failing project. The success of it could depend on you. Show you're willing to take initiative. People are relying on you.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h3 class="grand title" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h3><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>Rodent home</li><li>Pasta pastry</li><li>Smart award</li><li>A promise to grow</li><li>Cat's gloves</li><li>50% giggle</li><li>Hot drink charge</li><li>Sleeky detective</li><li>How ocme tears</li><li>Sharp speech impediment</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>Help - Yesterday - Revolution</li><li>Moth - Meat - Medicine</li><li>Robert Kennedy - Julius Caesar - John Lennon</li><li>Orchestras - Ears - Brakes</li><li>Cliff - Springboard - Platform</li><li>Radio - Brain - Tidal</li><li>Shag - Red - Magic</li><li>Snow - Corn - Dandruff</li><li>Tennis - Small Claims - Supreme</li><li>Surprise - Search - Slumber</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Able Owe Knees Hand Which</li><li>Ace Date Tough Gay Hoss</li><li>Ace Heal Ink Van</li><li>Ace Heck Hunch Ants</li><li>Ace Height Force or Ri</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" class="no-filter" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable19.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand title" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section class="hider">Show Answers!</section><section class="hidden"><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Mouse House</li><li>Noodle Strudel</li><li>Wize Prize</li><li>Growth Oath</li><li>Kitten's Mittens</li><li>Half Laugh</li><li>Tea Fee</li><li>Sly Spy</li><li>Why Cry</li><li>Crisp Lisp</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Songs by the Beatles</li><li>Balls</li><li>All were assassinated</li><li>They have drums</li><li>Dives</li><li>Waves</li><li>Carpets</li><li>Flakes</li><li>Courts</li><li>Partie</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>A Bologna Sandwich</li><li>A State of Chaos</li><li>A Ceiling Fan</li><li>A Second Chance</li><li>A Sight for Sore Eye</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Words of wisdom</li><li>All dressed up and no place to go</li><li>Split two ways</li><li>High chair</li><li>Flat tire</li><li>Wake up, little Suzie</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>Because it has Greece at the bottom.</p></section></section></section><footer><p>Information Scraped from: <a href="https://www.riddles.com/riddle-of-the-day">riddles.com</a>, <a href="https://www.onthisday.com/">onthisday.com</a>, <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quote_of_the_day">brainyquote.com</a>, <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/what-is-today/">nationaltoday.com</a>, <a href="https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/8cd1a4fdf1a3fddbdd025b0f20f49602aa7fc5b410cf85c2866e485bd1e375e4">weather.com</a>, <a href="https://www.astrology.com/">astrology.com<a>, <a href="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com">thinkablepuzzles.com</a></p></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='javascript/darktoggle.js') }}"></script></body></html>
