Unfortunately, this person probably isn't emotionally available right now (no matter how available they may look). You need to pull your heart out of this situation and look at it with practical eyes. Is all of this stress really worth the potential payoff? Probably not. Moving on might be difficult, but it may be the only way to deal with a situation in which you're not getting what you deserve.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> Your social status is on a rapid upswing, and you'll be in high demand by a wide array of people. Invitations will be coming your way left and right, and you should let yourself be as choosy as you want to be about the ones you say yes to. Resist making any formal alliances with people until you know who they are and what they're all about. Your sentimentality is at an all-time high right now, so you could be seeing a connection where none truly exists.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> If someone you know has recently been making a lot of promises but delivering on none of them, today is the day to say something. Ask this person why so many obligations have been neglected lately. The difficulty of your discussion is in direct proportion to how close the relationship is, so remember this for the future. It's not quite time for an ultimatum, but it is time to stop letting yourself be taken advantage of by people you like.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> You're positively bursting with pride today, but it's not the bad kind that alienates people and makes you show off. It's the good kind, the kind that fills you with confidence and encourages you to lead people and inspire them. This is a great day to start a new group activity, especially if you're in charge. Social situations will be imbued with a very strong energy. It will almost feel as though a powerful current is carrying you and your people along.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> Have the celebrities in your social circle been getting a bit too big for their britches lately? Popular people are not always popular for the right reasons, and the chinks in their armor are beginning to show today. If you are good friends with them, you'll be doing them a favor by telling them that it's time to fess up to the fact that they're only human. But if they aren't your friends, it's time to watch and learn how poor behavior gets rewarded.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> Could there be too much happening in your life right now? Not according to the stars. They say that your capacity for thinking fast, working faster, and enjoying every minute of the craziness is incredibly high. If you have a lot on your plate, pile some more on! You have the time and you have the desire. Stepping up and taking on more responsibilities today will lead you to a better future, financially and romantically. People like busy people.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> Pinning all of your hopes on one person isn't a wise idea right now, so try to be realistic about your expectations. This person might be pretty awesome, but they may not be capable of delivering what you want right now. It wouldn't be wise to express your fears or concerns to this person. Any undue pressure will make this already imperfect idea even more problematic. Things are working just fine as they are, so why try to change them now?</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> If you've been separated from the world while nursing a bruised ego, it's time for you to get back into the game! Whether you feel ready or not, today is the day to step up and shift back into life. You have a lot of beauty and strength to showcase, and there are plenty of people who want to have a front-row seat for the show. There is more interest in you right now than you think. You are missing an amazing opportunity by standing on the sidelines.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> Having good luck isn't always a passive experience. You can't just wait for a kind genie to arrive at your doorstep and grant you three wishes. In order to enjoy more luck in your life right now, you have to create it, starting today. Put more positive energy out there, and do your own best impersonation of a kind fairy godparent to someone in your life. An anonymous gift or good deed will go a long way toward putting more happy coincidences in your life.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Your desire to make a connection with new people deserves to be satisfied, so reach out and approach that person who has been making you smile lately. It won't be difficult to make new friends if that's truly what you want. Your values are shared by more people than you might realize, so go out and explore the world around you. Get out of your car and walk around. Let your physical energy mix up with the energy of other people.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> Paradoxically, accepting a compromise could put you in a much more powerful position than pushing aggressively to get your own way. Showing that you have the maturity and tact to negotiate with someone who rubs you the wrong way will send a very powerful signal to some important people you want to impress. Let go of the "my way or the highway" mentality. Think about long-term gains, not short-term rewards.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> Eavesdropping on interesting conversations can be a fun pastime, but it can also get you into a lot of trouble if you aren't careful. Play it safe and mind your own business whenever possible today. You don't necessarily have to totally give up the pleasure of listening to other people talking, but resist the temptation to butt in or get involved in some way. How other people choose to live their lives might shock you, but you needn't tell them that.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand title" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> Take a look at where you're spending your money today. Is there a way you can reduce your weekly budget, even by just a little? Maybe it's giving up that midmorning latte or bringing your lunch to work instead of going out. In any case, small changes will add up over time.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> Have you let anger get the better of you lately? Now is the perfect time to look at your life objectively and decide what patterns of behavior you would like to change. There's not a lot of room for flighty emotions today, so try to be practical and logical in your dealings with others. Temper tantrums won't be tolerated.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> Trust those little flashes of inspiration you've been getting lately. You know you're on the right path, but you might have moments of doubt when the outside pictures don't match your desires. Soon they will. You just have to be patient.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> If you want to make some changes in your life, you have to set yourself up for success. You can't quit smoking and keep a pack of cigarettes around. You can't get in shape without exercising more. Get the idea? Figure out what you need to add or subtract from your life in order to reach your goals right now.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> In a rut? Maybe it's time you changed your daily routine so you're not doing the same old song and dance all the time. Spice things up. Take your partner out on a hot date. Wear something snazzy to work. Little changes can keep you from feeling bored right now.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> Someone might come to you for much-needed advice today, so give your thoughts and opinions. You have a knack for saying the right things, and this situation will be no different. Speak from the heart and be honest with this person.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> Is there someone in your life you've lost touch with? It's time to reconnect with an old friend or extend an olive branch to someone. Let bygones be bygones already. A willingness to let go and move forward is all you need.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> Express those feelings you've been sweeping under the rug. There's no time like the present to get things out in the open. What do you have to lose? Others might not even be aware of what's going on, so your best bet is to just speak up.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> Your creative juices are flowing, so don't ignore the inspiration when it hits! Limiting yourself now would be like putting a kink in the garden hose. With blind faith, just believe that you can accomplish whatever you want to right now. It's not impossible, despite how you may feel.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> Have you been letting someone walk all over you lately? Others will only take you for granted if you let them. It's time to step up and demand the respect you deserve. Take responsibility for yourself and your life. You're the only one who can.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Is a white lie worth it? You might realize today that it's just better to tell the truth. Maybe it feels like you're sparing someone's feelings in the moment, but in the end you're only harming yourself. Work on being more honest today.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> Someone you haven't had time for might be feeling a little slighted today. Make the effort to reach out, even if you have to try more than once. Sometimes showing you care means being persistent.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h3 class="grand title" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h3><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>Burn insect</li><li>An uncooked animals foot</li><li>Animal watcher</li><li>What the frozen water costs</li><li>Breakable pan</li><li>Final explosion</li><li>Cool shoe spike</li><li>Nocturnal battle</li><li>Plant the line</li><li>Spirit party giver</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>A Wagon - A Weed- A Practical Joke</li><li>New York - An Airline - A Jacuzzi</li><li>Alarm - Grandfather - Cuckoo</li><li>A Cherry - A Wine Glass - A Rose</li><li>Gun - Baby - Talcum</li><li>Fan - Express - Junk</li><li>Mouse - Booby - Live</li><li>I - V - X</li><li>Palm - Pine- Christmas</li><li>A Boat - A Cradle - Van Halen</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Bee Way Rough Thud Hog</li><li>Bees Items Say Elf</li><li>Below They Whiz Ill</li><li>Bet Relate Thin Heifer</li><li>Better Hos</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" class="no-filter" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable34.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand title" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section class="hider">Show Answers!</section><section class="hidden"><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Fry Fly</li><li>Raw Paw</li><li>Critter Sitter</li><li>Ice Price</li><li>Brittle Skittle</li><li>Last Blast</li><li>Freeze Cheese</li><li>Night Fight</li><li>Sow Row</li><li>Ghost Host</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>They are all pulled</li><li>They all have jets</li><li>Clocks</li><li>They have stems</li><li>Powders</li><li>Mail</li><li>Traps</li><li>Roman numerals</li><li>Trees</li><li>They roc</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Beware of the Dog</li><li>Beside Himself</li><li>Blow the Whistle</li><li>Better Late Than Never</li><li>Bed of Rose</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>High IQ</li><li>Misunderstanding</li><li>Backwards Somersault</li><li>No One is Perfect</li><li>Upwards Battle</li><li>Times Up</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>Smoke.</p></section></section></section><footer><p>Information Scraped from: <a href="https://www.riddles.com/riddle-of-the-day">riddles.com</a>, <a href="https://www.onthisday.com/">onthisday.com</a>, <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quote_of_the_day">brainyquote.com</a>, <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/what-is-today/">nationaltoday.com</a>, <a href="https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/8cd1a4fdf1a3fddbdd025b0f20f49602aa7fc5b410cf85c2866e485bd1e375e4">weather.com</a>, <a href="https://www.astrology.com/">astrology.com<a>, <a href="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com">thinkablepuzzles.com</a></p></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='javascript/darktoggle.js') }}"></script></body></html>
