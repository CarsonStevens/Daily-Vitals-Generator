It could be either out of commission or useless for the type of message you need to send to a certain someone. Don't assume that words on a screen are going to adequately convey what you mean. They won't. Even if you aren't thrilled by the idea, you need to talk this issue over face-to-face. You can make the conversation more enjoyable by scheduling it over lunch or dinner.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> If someone is just not getting the message you're trying to send them, today it's time for you to give up, at least for a while. They might be ready to listen soon, but you shouldn't hold your breath. You don't really need them, and it's a waste of your time to keep knocking on their emotional doors if they won't let you in. What you wanted might still happen, but not with their assistance. That's okay. You're ready for a new cast of characters in your life anyway.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> Generating ideas is easier than ever today thanks to your unique way of looking at things. Some people see a blank sheet of paper and get panicked about how they're going to fill it. Today, you'll see that same blank sheet of paper and immediately ask for another in order to have enough space to get down everything that's going on inside your head. All this activity is great for your attitude, but be careful. It will also make time fly!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> Be wary of a friend whose lifestyle is getting a bit extreme in your eyes. They represent a cautionary tale that you don't need to learn. You've taken your educational walks on the wild side, and you may again, although right now isn't the appropriate time to do so. You don't need to relive anything through this person. If you need to get some distance from them temporarily, don't feel guilty about it. Do what's right for you. They wouldn't expect you to do anything less.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> Are you getting a reputation as someone who's too stubborn? Now more than ever it's important to open yourself up to new ideas and new ways of doing things. Sometimes change is bad, but most of the time change is good. It demonstrates that when you're made aware of new information, you factor it into your philosophy accordingly. Sticking with one idea no matter what the facts say isn't admirable, it's dangerous. Moving forward in your life requires you to move forward in your thinking.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> Someone in your life is going through some demanding work issues right now. This stress could be affecting their personality. It could be leaking into your relationship and affecting it in a negative way. Let this person know that you're concerned, but don't rush at them with demands to "shape up or else!" The last thing they need is more pressure! Just be compassionate. Let them know that you'll be patient and supportive for as long as they need you to be.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> Today, you need to explore areas that you know little or nothing about. Experience new things and you'll become a more interesting person. If a conversation drifts into political issues or world events that you know nothing about, don't walk away or change the subject. Keep listening. Ask questions so that you can be on the same level as everyone else. People will love the chance to tell you what they know.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> Don't make assumptions about that state of your financial situation right now. It could be better than you think, but then again, it could be worse than you think. Before you go shopping, check your bank account to make sure you know where you stand, financially speaking. If you don't make sure you're flush, then you could be taking a big risk, and it may not pay off. There is a possibility that some of your money is tied up in an automatic payment snag.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> Are you doubting your position in your social circle right now? You need to have a little bit more faith that you're still loved by your friends. Sure, you should watch how you deal with other people right now, but that's only because they have weird stuff going on in their lives, not because there is anything wrong with you. A new beginning is coming quite soon, something that will excite your friends and unite all of you in a common cause.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Try to avoid flighty people today, especially in social situations. Their unfocused energy could cause you to lose your focus, too, and that wouldn't be good for the positive momentum you've been enjoying! If a friend has promised to meet you somewhere but you have a feeling they won't show or will make you wait longer than you should, call them up and reschedule or cancel outright. Friends who are true friends won't have a problem with it.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> There is more than one way to get a connection going with someone else. Why do you insist on trying the same tactics over and over? Your style might not be the same as everyone else's, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don't try to mimic what they do. The people who (in your eyes) are more attractive, more intelligent, or more entertaining are following their own paths. If you follow your own path, too, then everyone will finally see what a gift you are.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> The clarity you had about your feelings for someone is dissolving a little bit today, but have no fear. This confusion you're experiencing is a totally normal part of being in a relationship or friendship. Nobody's perfect, so if you thought they were, you may now know you were wrong. Can you still accept them once you've seen their imperfections?</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand title" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> You might be expected to make a decision on the fly today. Which path will you take? It might feel overwhelming at first, but a few quiet hours, or even minutes, of quiet contemplation should be all you need to get clear with yourself about what you really want.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> Have you been hanging with the wrong crowd lately? Some less than trustworthy types might be infiltrating your circle, and it's time to weed them out and seal them off. You're better than that. Don't let unsavory people drag you down.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> You may spend a good portion of the day clearing up a miscommunication with a friend or family member. Whatever happened to pit you two against one another, it's time to let it go and move on. Life's too short to waste on petty arguments.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> Past negative experiences may have you questioning whether or not to move forward with a current relationship, project, or life change. But give this one a chance. It's possible you're overreacting and there's nothing to worry about. Only time will tell.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> Big decisions should not be taken lightly today. Consider all sides of the situation before you do something drastic. If you're not sure but you have to act anyway, just keep your cards close to your chest and don't let others in on your secrets (yet).</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> An unexpected offer could pop up today, forcing you to consider what it is you really want out of life. There might be a lot to think about now, but this is an important process that will help you clarify your life's goals and get closer to what you want to do with your time here on the planet. Embrace the process.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> You're usually such a social butterfly, but you might not feel like being around others too much today. It's possible that both your body and your brain are maxed out from too much work. Try to rest, relax, and recuperate this weekend. You've earned it.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> Have you been hesitant to seal the deal about something? It's time to either fish or cut bait. There's no room for indecision right now, especially if you've pretty much already decided and you know your mind is made up. Now it's just time to execute things. Go on and do it.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> Have you done some damage in your relationships lately? There's only so long that you'll be able to avoid this, so why not just tackle it head-on? Trying to wrap yourself up in chores and social activities won't make the problem go away, at least not forever.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> You're in hibernation mode. You're not feeling like doing much today, and this could keep you from feeling social when an invitation comes from a friend. Are you a little unsure about your future right now? Try to find your way through the emotional haze. You'll have the answers you want in no time.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Is there some competitive energy going on between you and a loved one? It might be time to step back and just let this person win. After all, is it really worth getting upset over? If you think long and hard and the answer is no, just give it a rest.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> The lethargy you've been feeling lately could reach an all-time low today. Just can't seem to get out of bed? Not motivated to get anything done? Maybe this is a sign that you need some alone time to deal with your feelings. Forgo social activities tonight and just have some "me" time. Try to get to the bottom of what's bugging you.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h3 class="grand title" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h3><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>Grab a quick look at</li><li>The picnic pest is unable</li><li>Understood color</li><li>Wet winner</li><li>Imitation hoe</li><li>Shy plaything</li><li>Unusual fish</li><li>Unusual seat</li><li>Salary madness</li><li>Solar enjoyment</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>The Brain - The Lung - The Ear</li><li>Spider - Fiddler - Hermit</li><li>Back - Butterfly - Side</li><li>A Car - A Tree - An Elephant</li><li>A Bear - A Hammer - A Lobster</li><li>Finish - Fishing - Dotted</li><li>Metal - Radar - Lie</li><li>Stop - Spot - Strobe</li><li>Trap - French - Glass</li><li>State - Sales - Income</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Burr Train Holds</li><li>Brit Knees Peers</li><li>Black Beer Herd</li><li>Bon Knee Ankle Hide</li><li>By Chore Du</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" class="no-filter" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable3.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand title" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section class="hider">Show Answers!</section><section class="hidden"><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Sneak Peek</li><li>Ant Can't</li><li>Knew Hue</li><li>Damp Champ</li><li>Fake Rake</li><li>Coy Toy</li><li>Odd Cod</li><li>Rare Chair</li><li>Wage Rage</li><li>Sun Fun</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>They have lobes</li><li>Crabs</li><li>Swimming strokes</li><li>They have trunks</li><li>They have claws</li><li>Lines</li><li>Detectors</li><li>Lights</li><li>Doors</li><li>Taxe</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Burt Reynolds</li><li>Britney Spears</li><li>Blackbeard</li><li>Bonnie and Clyde</li><li>Bite Your Tongu</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</li><li>X Marks the Spot</li><li>Put two and two Together</li><li>Just Right</li><li>I Before E Except After C</li><li>High Seas</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.</p></section></section></section><footer><p>Information Scraped from: <a href="https://www.riddles.com/riddle-of-the-day">riddles.com</a>, <a href="https://www.onthisday.com/">onthisday.com</a>, <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quote_of_the_day">brainyquote.com</a>, <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/what-is-today/">nationaltoday.com</a>, <a href="https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/8cd1a4fdf1a3fddbdd025b0f20f49602aa7fc5b410cf85c2866e485bd1e375e4">weather.com</a>, <a href="https://www.astrology.com/">astrology.com<a>, <a href="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com">thinkablepuzzles.com</a></p></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='javascript/darktoggle.js') }}"></script></body></html>
