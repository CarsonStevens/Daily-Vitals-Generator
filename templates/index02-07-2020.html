You may not have as much free time as you're used to. Get in some quality time with your friends, and if you're in a relationship, make sure your partner understands the time crunch you might be experiencing soon. If it's a new relationship, your unavailability could serve as a very effective test. Luckily, this person could wow you with their patience and dedication.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> Looking around today, you may be struck with a little bit of envy. Everyone seems to have something you want. But before you send out invitations to your pity party, get some perspective. The evil green-eyed monster has only been able to bite you today because you're losing sight of what you do have in your life. There are missing elements, true. But a hopeful energy surrounds you, as well as people who cherish you. You have enough to be happy, and that's all you need.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> Your heart wants one thing in your life right this very minute, but your head knows that it might not happen for a while. The battle between your impatient side and your pragmatic side will rage on today, with little (if any) resolution. This tension could cause you to lash out at people who try to push your buttons. You will probably tell yourself it serves them right for trying to get you riled up, but in the end, if you add to the animosity, you aren't doing yourself any favors.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> Open up your calendar and take a look at the months ahead. Today is an excellent day for long-term plans, so think up some new ideas about what you want to do and where you want to go over the next few months. Try to pencil in as many vacations, family reunions, dinner parties, solo excursions and romantic weekend trips as you can. There's no such thing as too early to nail down a date. Details will come easily, so why not try to set them in stone?</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> Give up something minor today and you'll ensure that the rest of the week is much more wonderful. It's time to make a small sacrifice in order to gain a greater good in your life. This may require giving up a bad habit or cutting out a type of food that you enjoy. If you fear you'll miss out by cutting back on the indulgences you enjoy, replace the bad ones with some good ones. Make time to get back into reading that juicy novel. Or finish that craft project you've been working on!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> Requests for you to alter your behavior can be hard to take. After all, there's nothing quite as annoying as someone telling you to chill out. You're in charge of your own feelings, and that's valid. You should feel what you feel when you feel it and not apologize. However, today reality dictates that you'll have to adjust your demeanor for your long-term success. Hold on to what you're feeling, but keep it from showing on your face. You can vent with a friend later.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> It's one thing to be flexible, but it's quite another to let someone take advantage of your kindness! Speak up if you're feeling like a doormat today. It's sad but true: Sometimes the only way to get respect is to demand it. In a public situation, you might feel too scared to make a scene, but who says you have to? There's no need to yell or get upset. A quiet word to the right person will get you all the satisfaction you need. Display the maturity that others lack.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> The toughest thing about being so on top of things right now is dealing with the fact that no one else seems to have a clue what they're doing! Your impatience for the ineptitude of certain people is nothing new, but today it could get pushed to the limit. Therefore, you'll be fighting a battle between your ever-thinning patience and your temper. Nothing is likely to happen on your ideal timetable today, so take a deep breath and let your patience win the battle.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> Your energy is high today, but you'll be out of sync with most people. While things are crystal clear to you right now, other people are still in the dark. And try as you might, you won't be able to get them to understand. Let them figure things out on their own. Don't let them hold you back. Keep going and they'll eventually catch up. The temporary separation might try your patience, but it can remind you how valuable the people in your life are.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Do you plan to spend some time with children today? Well, even if you spend the day surrounded by grown-ups, it might feel like you're stuck in a day care center. Expect a lot of petty behavior from someone who gets moody when they don't get what they want when they want it. Your first instinct will be to deal with these people compassionately, but there is no need for that. You can feel free to ignore their negative energy and move away from their tantrums.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> You are learning how love can come in many different varieties. And while this is very exciting, it can also be very confusing. Just remember to take things very slowly in any new relationships, and don't make too many assumptions about your growing feelings for someone. Let them just be what they are, and don't try to pigeonhole them into a certain category. Not everything has to have a name. Part of the magic of building something together is making it new and unique to the two of you.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> You can't always be in perfect sync with the people around you. Today, it may feel like you're missing out on the joke or got to the party a bit late, but this feeling will soon pass. Don't let it unnerve you or weaken your self-confidence. You may have some special plans coming up, and they could be distracting you right now. The good news is that by being out of step, you're getting a revealing look at some key players. This insight will come in handy later.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand title" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> Out of the blue, people could look to you for your leadership skills today. Maybe you'll be in charge of coordinating a social event with friends or organizing a last-minute dinner with your family. You can lead, and you can do it well. Don't shy away from showing you're dependable when others need you.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> If you want to succeed, try to find someone whose strengths are a good complement for your weaknesses. Pair up with people in your life who offer you what you don't already have, whether in romance, business, or friendships. This will help you create the strongest alliances.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> Independence is an admirable trait, but only relying on yourself isn't. If you need a helping hand, just ask for it. More than likely, everyone in your life is willing to help out. You just have to say the word.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> It might be time to bend the rules a bit when it comes to romance. Don't feel like you need to do things by the book, because an unconventional approach might just work for you today. Think outside the box. You're bound to come up with something creative.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> Are you feeling creative today? Show off your sense of style and head out on the town tonight. You never know who you might meet when all dolled up. If you're not feeling up to the crazy bar scene, round up a few pals and at least go out to a movie.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> Is there an equal give-and-take happening in your relationships? It's time to strive for balance if that's what you're lacking. This should be a partnership, not a dictatorship. Whether you're the one doing the dominating or it's someone else, it's time to reset the power structure.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> Are you finding it tough to stay on top of your chores and errands? If you're feeling like a bump on a log, try to focus on things that require less brainpower, like organizing your files or cleaning the fridge. By tonight, you should be feeling much more on top of things.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> Resist the temptation to make someone else the butt of your jokes today. One of your friends or family members might not take kindly to snarky remarks. As funny as you might think you are, play it safe for the next 24 hours. You don't want to offend the wrong person.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> The only way you're going to get the answers you need is if you allow time to take its course. If something can stand the test of time, you know it's real, solid, and valuable. If it crumbles under pressure, it's not. Simple as that!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> Does a one-legged duck swim in circles? If something is totally obvious to everyone but you, maybe it's time you reconsidered your opinion. Denial can be a powerful force, and it's possible you're drowning in it. Ask for the advice of an honest pal who always gives it to you straight.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> There's no rest for the wicked. Remember this when you're tempted to get revenge on someone who has harmed you. This person will get their due in time. Leave well enough alone for now. No need to get involved in any messy altercations.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> You've done hard miles. This gives you the right to weigh in on something when your friends or family members start discussing it. Don't hold back. Your wisdom can serve them and possibly keep them from making a bad mistake.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h3 class="grand title" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h3><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>Advertise, TV clicker</li><li>Elegant backbone</li><li>Food sale</li><li>Stag vehicle</li><li>Airplane collection</li><li>The boy's test</li><li>Top exam</li><li>Sheep jelly</li><li>Ranch appeal</li><li>Boisterous assembly</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>A Ball - A Fish - A Cold</li><li>A Ball - A Salad - A Coin</li><li>A Cork - A Question - A Balloon</li><li>A Bottle - A Baseball Player - A Mushroom</li><li>A Bell - Mouth - A Shoe</li><li>A Tug of War - The Nightly News - A Boat</li><li>Seventeen - Time - People</li><li>A Basketball Court - A Highway - A Bowling Alley</li><li>Fog - A Jack - A Body Builder</li><li>A Hockey Game - A Restaurant - A Bank</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Delights Havens Dime</li><li>Den Nest Amen Us</li><li>Depot Stall Fizz</li><li>Diamond Dime Hug Hen</li><li>Diarrhea Fan Fra</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" class="no-filter" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable7.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand title" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section class="hider">Show Answers!</section><section class="hidden"><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Promote Remote</li><li>Fine Spine</li><li>Meal Deal</li><li>Buck Truck</li><li>Jet Set</li><li>His Quiz</li><li>Best Test</li><li>Lamb Jam</li><li>Farm Charm</li><li>Loud Crowd</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>they are caught</li><li>they are tossed</li><li>they are popped</li><li>they have caps</li><li>they have tongues</li><li>they have anchors</li><li>they are magazines</li><li>they have lanes</li><li>they lift</li><li>they have check</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Daylight Savings Time</li><li>Dennis the Menace</li><li>The Post Office</li><li>Time and Time Again</li><li>Diary of Anne Fran</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Cry all the way to the bank</li><li>The stakes are high</li><li>That's too bad</li><li>Eyes in the back of my head</li><li>Miniskirt</li><li>All in All</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>A choice.</p></section></section></section><footer><p>Information Scraped from: <a href="https://www.riddles.com/riddle-of-the-day">riddles.com</a>, <a href="https://www.onthisday.com/">onthisday.com</a>, <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quote_of_the_day">brainyquote.com</a>, <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/what-is-today/">nationaltoday.com</a>, <a href="https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/8cd1a4fdf1a3fddbdd025b0f20f49602aa7fc5b410cf85c2866e485bd1e375e4">weather.com</a>, <a href="https://www.astrology.com/">astrology.com<a>, <a href="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com">thinkablepuzzles.com</a></p></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='javascript/darktoggle.js') }}"></script></body></html>
