His wife immediately called the police. The police questioned the wife and staff and got these alibis: The Wife said she was sleeping. The Cook was cooking breakfast. The Gardener was picking vegetables. The Maid was getting the mail. The Butler was cleaning the closet. The police instantly arrested the murderer.

This isn't a comfortable feeling, but don't beat yourself up about it! For too long you've been putting the needs and wishes of other people above your own. This could be a natural reaction. Your mind is trying to find balance. Don't you deserve to be a bit selfish once in a while? You don't have to ignore a friend's call, but you can feel free to let it go to voicemail.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> It's a day when you'll be seeking greater depth when everybody else is just content to skim along the surface of things. No one is right and no one is wrong in their respective desires. But you won't find the scintillating conversations you might be seeking. If you have a strong urge to get philosophical with one of your friends and they're not interested, find another way to satisfy your intellectual hunger. Check out some websites about whatever topic interests you. Take charge of getting what you want.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> Fast action is required today. There's a problem that needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible, before it gets too big to attack. Be sure to have whatever tools you need to have on hand. Be ready to use them whenever and wherever they're necessary. You need to concentrate on forward motion in your life, not on backward glances. You have no time to waste deliberating over the best way to improve a less than perfect situation.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> You could use a good, long day of self-nurturing! Why don't you cancel that appointment that isn't all that important, skip out on that meeting you really don't want to go to, or call up that nice but slightly exhausting friend and postpone your lunch date? This day should be yours and yours alone! You have to consciously make the time to be alone if you ever want to give yourself the peace and quiet you need. Don't think you'll enjoy flying solo? Try it for an hour. You'll be surprised.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> You're going to have a really fun day, especially if you're working on something with lots of details and complex elements. Right now is a great time for you to put all your plans and preparations into motion, because things you begin today are bound to be very successful. All the right pieces are in place, and the right people are supporting you. They are ready, willing, and eager to get in on the ground floor of your next adventure!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> Take a risk. Try your hand at something you've never done before. It doesn't have to be as adventurous as skydiving or rock climbing. It can be as simple as baking a cake for the first time or trying a different style of clothing. Switch things up and you might just turn yourself on to a new favorite thing. You're full of surprises, and you can even surprise yourself once in a while. Stretching your knowledge isn't all about academic learning. Life experiences count, too.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> It's not always the best idea to be direct in your communication. Take today, for example. You might get a lot further by being more subtle. The people you're dealing with are touchy folks who enjoy their privacy. They won't take too kindly to blunt questions and forceful conversational styles. Instead, warm them up with some observational humor. Do some people-watching with them. You'll get a great sense of what they're all about and what appeals to them.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> As careful as you may be right now, you don't have to hesitate when it comes to taking risks. Luck is on your side, and things are definitely looking up! The bad vibes are long gone, and they show no signs of popping up again in the near future. If you have some sort of examination or test today, you're sure to do even better than you expect. It's also a great time to take a walk on the wild side. You'll have a fun adventure without putting yourself in any real harm.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> You're pretty smart, and you know it, but you want to get even smarter when it comes to one specific thing. Find an expert you admire and pick their brain about whatever it is that's captivating you right now. If you can't talk to them face-to-face, shoot them an e-mail. Ask them the questions you need answers to, and find out how they've achieved what you want to achieve. The best way to learn is to go to the source. You want to hear it from the horse's mouth.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Add more structure to your life and you could see some amazing results. Any problem you've been struggling with will fade away once you get yourself more disciplined and better focused. Do you have a set bedtime? If not, pick a time that will always give you at least eight hours of sleep. How are you doing with your savings account? Set up a real budget that requires you to deposit a set amount each month. It doesn't have to be a huge amount. It just has to be something. Letting yourself go isn't wise.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> It's time to let your hospitable nature shine a bit more brightly. Sometimes you get so caught up in your day-to-day life that you forget to take the time to welcome new energy and new people into your life. Every day you encounter someone you've never seen before, whether it's a new checker at the grocery store or the new person you've been assigned to work with! Today, savor this meeting a little bit more and smile a bit wider.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> You should always think before speaking, but today you shouldn't think for too long! There is a fine line between mulling things over and putting things off. If you don't pounce on a hot opportunity today, it will cool off, or worse, someone else will beat you to the punch. It might seem like a good idea to weigh all the pros and cons, but it's not. If your gut tells you to go for it, then go for it. Faster action will get you quicker rewards.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand title" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> You'd rather hit the snooze button than head into an early meeting, but no one can cover for you right now. Show up and fulfill your obligations. Later, you should get some downtime to spend with your friends or work on personal projects at home.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> Helping others is part of your nature, but sometimes it can get in the way of helping yourself. What needs are you currently putting on the back burner to assist a friend or family member? The time has come to spend some more time on you.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> Objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear. Translation? You may need to hustle if you want to get something done it time or escape something before it catches up to you. Use your time wisely today, because you might not get a chance to finish up projects later.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> Are you trying to fit a square peg into a round hole? Pushing at something so hard is bound to end up in failure, so why go there? Relax and let go. Find a different way to approach the situation, one that involves much less effort.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> Time to rest up. You've been running yourself ragged lately, and people are starting to notice. Do you need a new hairstyle or new clothes? Whatever you have to do to revamp your look, work on it. Appearing professional is important right now.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> Are you having a hard time making decisions about your love life? You're usually the passionate, spontaneous one, but you might be unsure of what to do next. This is a good approach, however, so don't find fault with how you're feeling. Think about your options and choose wisely.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> When making a decision today, consider all sides of the situation. You may not have the facts you need to really understand everything completely, but aim to see the bigger picture. In the end, you should probably go with what seems fair for everyone, not what your heart is telling you to pick.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> Feel like you can do anything today? Being on top of the world is great, so make sure to use that energy. Go for a run in the park, get errands done at lunch, or brainstorm with your colleagues about a new project. Productivity is your middle name right now.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> Guilty pleasures are called so for a reason. Is it time to lay off the indulgences for a while? Going overboard might be a sign that you're trying to escape something in your life. You probably already know that a better approach would be to face it head-on.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> Dealing with your finances may not seem fun, but it's a necessary evil. Sit down and sort through bills and bank statements today. It's time to figure out where you can cut corners a bit, and where you might need to spend more.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> You know what they say, what we dislike in others is what we don't like about ourselves. Before you judge someone else for being quirky, think about your own flaws. You'll probably see more similarities than differences between you and this person.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> If things didn't go your way, know that the universe has something better in store for you. Continue to take action, and don't let failures slow your progress. Something is germinating far beneath the surface. When the time is right, a bud will sprout.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h3 class="grand title" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h3><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>Happy father</li><li>Stop the non-violence</li><li>Gasoline law</li><li>Purple fruit, chewing stick</li><li>Arguing sister</li><li>A tool for chopping blocks of paraffin</li><li>Postage winner</li><li>Big pituitary</li><li>Grab a quick look at</li><li>Evening airplane trip</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>A Sprinter - A City - An Icehouse</li><li>A Beetle - A Fox - A Rabbit</li><li>A Toe - A Carpenter - A Finger</li><li>A Basketball - A Turkey - A Christmas Stocking</li><li>Chicago - Smokey - Yogi</li><li>Easter - Christmas - Virgin</li><li>Draw - Fade - Slice</li><li>Yellow - Scarlet - Cabin</li><li>Toilets - Eyes - Trash Cans</li><li>Finger - Oil - Latex</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Comb Bee Forth Ease Dorm</li><li>Con Face Shores Hens</li><li>Cone Width Thaw End</li><li>Core Tease Inns Eh Shin</li><li>Cough He Anchor Re</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" class="no-filter" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable42.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand title" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section class="hider">Show Answers!</section><section class="hidden"><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Glad Dad</li><li>Cease Peace</li><li>Fuel Rule</li><li>Plum Gum</li><li>Quibbling Sibling</li><li>Wax Axe</li><li>Stamp Champ</li><li>Grand Gland</li><li>Sneak Peek</li><li>Night Flight</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>They all have blocks</li><li>Cars by Volkswagen</li><li>They have nails.</li><li>They are stuffed</li><li>Bears</li><li>Islands</li><li>Golf terms</li><li>Fevers</li><li>They have lids</li><li>They are paint</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Calm Before the Storm</li><li>Confess Your Sins</li><li>Gone With the Wind</li><li>Court is in Session</li><li>Coffee and Crea</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Step Ladder</li><li>Worlds Apart</li><li>Side Burns</li><li>Deep in Thought</li><li>Tiny Bubbles</li><li>Do Without</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>It was the Maid.
