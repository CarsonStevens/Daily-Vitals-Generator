But when you choose to give someone a gift, it's theirs to do with what they will. There are no strings attached unless you put them there to begin with. You can't get mad if they're not treating your money the way you would. All you can do is keep this in mind the next time they come asking for funds.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> Looking forward in life is a great way to aim for positive changes, and living in the moment is always good, but today it's looking back that will offer you the most reward, entertainment, and insight. You may think that the past few months were fairly uneventful, but they weren't. Time has given you a fresh perspective on the adventures you've had, and your newfound insight will give you inspiration for the next adventure you tackle.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> Feed the emotional side of your brain today. It's hungry! Explore the music, fashion, art, or fiction that stimulates your mind and taps into emotions you don't often get a chance to experience. This act could also serve as a convenient escape from the stresses of the day and the political machinations that are hijacking your time. You might be feeling a little powerless in some arenas, so indulging in artistic pursuits will be a great way to feel more power in your life again.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> With a strong, bright energy driving the next 24 hours, you're bound to attract more attention than usual today, so don't you dare be shy! You should be proud to share what you think with everyone around you. People are in an usually receptive frame of mind. Use your wit and creativity to make your point, and weave in a heavy dose of your philosophy. It's not preaching when you dress it up in such an entertaining package. You can change important minds today.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> Give something a final farewell push today—a project, a relationship, or even just an old piece of furniture. It's taking up way too much room in your life and in your heart. You've done all you can with it, and now it's someone else's duty to carry it on down the line. This release will lighten your load and make you feel quite carefree for a few days. Take advantage of this positive energy by planning a lavish night out with a few close friends.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> As you travel down the road today, you have to ignore the tantalizing billboards that promise fascinating sights and bizarre tourist attractions. You're on a mission, and you can't afford to be pushed off your route. Just grab the wheel tighter and keep going. Sure, you will never know what you missed out on, but then again, you will never know what you missed out on. Keep your eyes on the prize and keep going forward!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> Feel like you've been through an emotional ringer lately? Take heart. You're due for a break now. Your great attitude has made everything go very smoothly lately, so good for you! Tempers are cooling, fortunes are turning, and you're set for a traveling opportunity. You'll be able to learn more about a culture or cultural event that you've always been curious about. Fill today with exploration and feed your curiosity. It will relax your heart and stimulate your mind.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> If people have been disappointing you lately, have faith that things will turn around soon—because they will! Try to be more open about the fact that people are full of surprises. Sometimes when they make a kind gesture, offer up a compliment, or just smile your way, it can make your day. There are so many fresh possibilities just about to enter your life. What you need to do today is let yourself believe that your future holds more happiness than you past ever did.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> While working in a partnership today, don't be surprised if your teammate acts a bit more critical of your decisions or actions than you'd like. You're centered on tackling the more creative aspects of this task, but they aren't. Their mind is much more focused on the small details of time, place, and budget, and this could be responsible for some increased tension. It might be time for you two to delegate responsibilities and carry on that way.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Of course you deserve a splurge or two now and then, but right now you should limit your shopping trips to the essentials. Grocery stores, gas stations, and the auto repair shop deserve your hard earned cash, but fancy restaurants, exclusive boutiques, and electronics stores might not, at least for now. Your bank account isn't as flush as you may think. And a quick review of your accounts could go a long way toward keeping you in a more economical state of mind.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> There is no excuse for being bored today, what with all the fun ideas and invitations being tossed your way. If you're not feeling in the mood to be social, then it would be in your best interests to fake it. Sometimes pretending you'd love to hang out with other people will help wake up your legitimate desire to be social. Spending time by yourself is valuable, but sometimes it can border on self-indulgence. Share yourself with the people in your life. They miss you a lot!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> To get the final inspiration you need to get through today, create a physical representation of your goals. You'll get bonus points for utilizing your famous creativity. Whether you draw a picture, write a song, or cook up a good dinner, your actions will help direct energy in the direction you desire. Pretend like your success is a foregone conclusion and it just might be. Speed is a priority today, too, so feel free to take any shortcuts that appear.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand title" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> Some days are notorious for a no-work attitude. Are you already making plans for your next vacation? No matter what kind of excuse you have for leaving your desk (and you'll dream up many), try to bite the bullet and finish things on a high note today. You'll be glad tomorrow when your workload is lighter.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> Idle hands are the devil's tools. If you don't have enough to do today, offer to help out a co-worker or friend. There's probably plenty that needs to be accomplished, and you'll stay out of trouble by lending a hand.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> Did you overindulge? If you're filling your body with all kinds of yucky stuff, it's no wonder you feel lethargic. Vow to do better in the future. You could face some temptations during the week (donut Friday, anyone?), but a strong resolve ought to carry you through.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> Upheaval in your career could feel like land mines blowing up all over the place, but don't freak out just yet. There's bound to be a positive outcome here. In fact, it could be even better than you imagine. Stay tuned and stay calm.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> You may not feel much like socializing today, but you'll probably have to anyway. Do the bare minimum when it comes to meetings and events, and try to slip away early, if possible. Too much stimulation could have you collapsing before the day even ends.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> Are your artistic skills feeling a bit blocked today? In your rush to finish something, you can probably tell that you're not producing quality work. Things might be beyond repair at this point, but don't let it happen again. Give yourself plenty of time to finish projects in the future.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> Don't have that get-up-and-go feeling today? Your energy level may seem pretty low, but that doesn't mean you can't still accomplish a lot. Focus on more mellow tasks, like answering e-mails or cleaning up your office. You may not have the energy to tackle big projects, but completing some smaller ones will make you feel productive.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> Don't doubt yourself today. Your ideas are as good as anyone else's, and they deserve to be recognized. If you have an intuitive hunch about something, go for it. You could be amazed at how quickly a seed of a thought can develop into a full-blown, living thing.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> If you recently dodged a bullet a work, just let sleeping dogs lie. No need to dredge up the past and rehash things. In fact, you'll probably be better off if you stay out of everyone's way today. Hole up in your office, get some work done, and start making plans for your next vacation.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> When working on a group project, make sure you and your teammates are all on the same page. Differences of opinion could destroy the integrity of your union, so try to come to some sort of compromise. Can't agree? Take a few days to mull it over, then head back to the negotiating table.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Saved by the bell, huh? Just make sure it doesn't come down to the last minute the next time you're in this situation. You may have gotten away with it this time, but don't expect to fool people a second time around.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> Smell a rat? Someone in your circle just may not be behaving in a trustworthy manner, and you spotted it a long time ago. Instead of giving this person a second, third, or fourth chance, cut the cord now. No more excuses and no more putting up with bad behavior.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h3 class="grand title" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h3><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>Metal cot</li><li>Artificial pond</li><li>A precise offensive move</li><li>Agile wood</li><li>Crafty cornea</li><li>50% giggle</li><li>A fence to prevent pinball playing</li><li>Cherish job</li><li>Inexpensive 4-wheeler</li><li>Not as good as poem</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>Furniture - Mustaches - Skis</li><li>Golf Course - A Coffee Shop - A Quart</li><li>He - She - They</li><li>Jupiter - Alaska - The Blue Whale</li><li>Wood Tick - Leech - Mosquito</li><li>Yawning - Laughter - Influenza</li><li>Improper - Unit - Mixed</li><li>Marigold - Mustard - Canary</li><li>Snake - Cavity - Bottomless</li><li>Kidney - String - Black</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Chick He Tub An An Us</li><li>Cause Tap Rid Tip Any</li><li>Cell Who Thief Lag</li><li>Chain Shove Seen Hurry</li><li>Check Can Tub Ends Ta</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" class="no-filter" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable45.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand title" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section class="hider">Show Answers!</section><section class="hidden"><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Lead Bed</li><li>Fake Lake</li><li>Exact Attack</li><li>Limber Timber</li><li>Sly Eye</li><li>Half Laugh</li><li>Arcade Blockade</li><li>Revere Career</li><li>Cheap Jeep</li><li>Worse Verse</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>They are waxed</li><li>They have cups</li><li>Pronouns</li><li>Largest of their kind</li><li>Blood suckers</li><li>They are contagious</li><li>Fractions</li><li>Shades of yellow</li><li>They have pits</li><li>Bean</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Chiquita Bananas</li><li>Cost a Pretty Penny</li><li>Salute The Flag</li><li>Change of Scenery</li><li>Jack and the Beanstal</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Two by Four</li><li>Getting Up in the Morning</li><li>Tennis Match</li><li>No Time for You</li><li>They Eyes are Bigger Than the Stomach</li><li>Just in Case</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>The King of Hearts in a deck of cards.</p></section></section></section><footer><p>Information Scraped from: <a href="https://www.riddles.com/riddle-of-the-day">riddles.com</a>, <a href="https://www.onthisday.com/">onthisday.com</a>, <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quote_of_the_day">brainyquote.com</a>, <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/what-is-today/">nationaltoday.com</a>, <a href="https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/8cd1a4fdf1a3fddbdd025b0f20f49602aa7fc5b410cf85c2866e485bd1e375e4">weather.com</a>, <a href="https://www.astrology.com/">astrology.com<a>, <a href="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com">thinkablepuzzles.com</a></p></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='javascript/darktoggle.js') }}"></script></body></html>
