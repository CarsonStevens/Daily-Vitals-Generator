You know, a list of all the things you want to do at some point during your time on the planet? Today, sit down and either start a list or review your progress on your existing list. Have you gone skydiving yet? (Do you really want to?) Check in with your ambitions. Where do you want to explore? The first step toward making it happen is thinking about making it happen. Use your imagination.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> You'll have a nourishing effect on anything you come into contact with today. Your words and actions can help things grow a lot more quickly. Speak the truth in every situation and good things will result. If you sense something new starting, give it your total attention. Push it gently forward, keep encouraging it, and watch its progress. Soon enough, you'll be looking at a beautiful, healthy, blossoming relationship that fills you with pride.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> The friendships you've been enjoying the most lately are the same friendships that are going to take you further in your life in the future. These people are your connection to new opportunities, and they have lots of good advice (that you should listen to). Another thing you should listen to is that little voice inside your head that's telling you to review your budget and watch what you spend. There's no need to worry. You just need to assess your accounts.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> Today may not be an easy day for you, but it will definitely be a productive one! Your quick mind will stay focused on one task with laser-like precision, which will enable you to avoid any distractions and tear right ahead of anyone else. If you're in any type of competitive environment today, you can expect to show very well, if not will the entire competition. All the different elements of your life are coming together. This could cause friction, but it will be worth it.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> It takes a lot less energy to explore something new than you might think, so enough with all the excuses! You have the time and all the energy you need. There's no way you can truly schedule an adventure, so stop consulting your calendar when people suggest something fun to do. You've got to dive right in and let the messy events of life dictate your day for once. Surprises are often pleasant if you're waiting for them with open arms!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> Settling down for some private quiet time could be harder than you ever thought it could be now. Social invitations could start piling up, so you'd better decide whether you want to climb out of your shell or stay away from the real world a little while longer. Getting away from the hustle and bustle of life should still be a top priority, so put off doing anything new unless doing so requires you to give up a life-changing opportunity.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> That mature voice inside your head keeps telling you that it shouldn't matter what other people think of you, and that voice is right. However, the voice inside your head is also telling you that, for now, you might have to take on a certain role in order to accomplish what you need to accomplish. This isn't a question of compromising who you are. You should never do that. But you might need to temper your passion with a veneer of etiquette and tact.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> You've wanted to do a certain something for a while now but haven't quite been able to give yourself the necessary nudge to get going, until today. This push may come in the form of someone else's inspiring story, a sudden influx of cash, or just that little voice inside of you getting louder. Whatever the cause, you'll finally get the push you need out of the nest. Hit the ground running and move forward on this fun and exciting adventure!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> There are some issues developing within your family or inner circle, and you may be able to help. One of the people you care about needs some words of wisdom that only you can supply. When you reach out to them, remember to be gentle. Put yourself in their place to better understand what they're going through. You might need to mine your memory, but a similar experience could give you the insight you need to say the right thing. Steer conversations toward the brighter future that is coming.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Your career is about to undergo a very exciting growth spurt, which could put a time crunch on some family plans. It's important to get ahead of this problem and head it off at the pass. Think up one or two backup plans just in case you have to work late or reschedule an important dinner with a sibling or parent. They'll understand you're in a crunch, and if you're considerate of them, they'll be considerate of you. Don' just assume they're ready to be put on the back burner.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> Someone's powerfully magnetic charisma could turn your head today and inspire you to get more involved in an altruistic pursuit. You're emerging from a somewhat self-reflective time into one where you want to share your time and viewpoint with others. Being connected to other people, even strangers, is important right now. Volunteering is a great option to explore today. Think of what you like most in your life and try to give someone else the same thing.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> Today, your focus should turn toward examining how you react to things that are beyond your control. A lot of unpredictable energy is swarming around you right now, sending confusing signals to the people you love. Something may happen that you can't influence. Instead of feeling powerless or frustrated, take advantage of the situation and steer it in a direction that's better for you and your people. You do have some power in this situation. Use it.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand title" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> Sticks and stones may break your bones, and, it turns out, words can actually hurt you! As immune as you might want to be to someone's criticisms, you could realize today just how vulnerable you actually are. This is okay. It just means you're human and you have real emotions. Try to release pent-up energy through exercise and fresh air.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> Got an axe to grind at work? It's probably better to have important conversations later in the day, because the mental fortitude of your opponents will be weaker as the day goes on, giving you a clear advantage. Writing down what you want to say will give you a clearer picture of how best to present your argument.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> Are you feeling the pressure to conform? Don't let anyone tell you that you need to walk the straight and narrow. You can put your own creative spin on things without varying too much from the norm. In fact, this might be one of your greatest talents. Utilize it.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> You know that old saying that a penny saved is a penny earned? Learn it! You've been too loose with the purse strings lately, and it's time to buckle down and take charge of your finances like an adult. No more frittering away your paychecks on useless stuff. Start saving. You never know when an emergency might occur.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> What seems like a really big deal right now is only just a drop in the bucket. Try to keep some perspective about life's challenges or seemingly overwhelming obstacles. They're not as bad as they appear. In time, you'll understand the lessons they're trying to deliver, if you don't already know.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> You might be tempted to break a few rules today. Want to play hooky from work? Skip out on that lunch date with your mother-in-law? While the voices inside might be urging you to rebel, it's probably better to color inside the lines. Any deviation could cause trouble.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. And no, we're not talking about real birds here. We're talking about knowing when you got a good thing and not letting it go in the hope of finding something better. Get the idea? Good.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> It might be tempting to give a selfish friend or spouse a taste of their own medicine, but retaliation is not the best approach right now. Take the high road; you know, the one where you act like a grown-up and don't stoop to their level.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> Tired of all the back-seat driver advice from friends? It's okay to tell them to zip it if the unwanted opinions become too loud. Just pay attention to your own voice and needs. What is your gut telling you? You probably already know what you need to do, so do it.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> Feeling a little frustrated with your current path in life? Maybe it's time you stopped listening to everyone else's advice and just followed your own heart. Does that sound easier said than done? If so, that's even more reason to start taking care of your own needs. They've been on the back burner long enough.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Feeling like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place? You might not know just how you're going to get out, but that doesn't mean there isn't a way. Stop. Think. Consider a possible escape route. If you calm down long enough to see clearly, you'll probably notice a way out you hadn't seen before.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> If you're tempted to blow off your family for a fun social event, remember that blood is thicker than water. The people who really matter are your siblings, kids, parents, and so on, not that band of cronies you spend your weekends with. Forgo an evening of drinks and have some good, old-fashioned family fun. You're overdue.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h3 class="grand title" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h3><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>Stop the non-violence</li><li>Termite haven</li><li>Orca story</li><li>Indigo church seat</li><li>Smart award</li><li>Munchie bag</li><li>Indigo church seat</li><li>Munchie bag</li><li>Sick want</li><li>Alphabet cardigan</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>Green - Moola - Dough</li><li>Playing - Time - Greeting</li><li>Punch - Hair - A Volleyball</li><li>High - Balance - Laser</li><li>Human - Rat - Relay</li><li>Cat - Dog - Gold</li><li>Toad - Foot - Bar</li><li>French - Eskimo - Hershey</li><li>Area - Fire - Zip</li><li>Gray - Red - Timber</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Dune Hot Feed Than Hymn Hulls</li><li>Each Oar Hard Tout</li><li>Ear Wig Hoe Hug Hen</li><li>Ease Ears Head Thinned Un</li><li>Ease See</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" class="no-filter" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable9.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand title" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section class="hider">Show Answers!</section><section class="hidden"><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Cease Peace</li><li>Pest Nest</li><li>Whale Tale</li><li>Blue Pew</li><li>Wize Prize</li><li>Snack Pack</li><li>Blue Pew</li><li>Snack Pack</li><li>Ill Will</li><li>Letter Sweater</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>slang for money</li><li>types of cards</li><li>they can be spiked</li><li>beams</li><li>races</li><li>fish</li><li>stools</li><li>kisses</li><li>codes</li><li>wolve</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Do Not Feed the Animals</li><li>Eat Your Heart Out</li><li>Here We Go Again</li><li>Easier Said Than Done</li><li>Easy Come, Easy G</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Foreign Policy</li><li>Party line</li><li>Covered Wagon</li><li>Back to the Future</li><li>Midwife</li><li>Off Sides</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>Your Breath.</p></section></section></section><footer><p>Information Scraped from: <a href="https://www.riddles.com/riddle-of-the-day">riddles.com</a>, <a href="https://www.onthisday.com/">onthisday.com</a>, <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quote_of_the_day">brainyquote.com</a>, <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/what-is-today/">nationaltoday.com</a>, <a href="https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/8cd1a4fdf1a3fddbdd025b0f20f49602aa7fc5b410cf85c2866e485bd1e375e4">weather.com</a>, <a href="https://www.astrology.com/">astrology.com<a>, <a href="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com">thinkablepuzzles.com</a></p></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='javascript/darktoggle.js') }}"></script></body></html>
