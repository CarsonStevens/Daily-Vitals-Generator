                <p> There is nothing standing in your way today! The road is wide open and slanted slightly downhill just enough to let you coast along nicely. Let your ambition take a back seat for today, while you just ride out the day and see what
                  it brings you. Go through this day as if you're pedaling leisurely through a blooming garden. Take your time and you'll find a few breathtakingly beautiful surprises, some comforting sights, and some very intriguing new specimens.

                <p> Believe it or not, everyone has a wellspring of creativity inside of them, especially you! Creativity is your spirit's way of communicating and revealing itself to the outside world, and it's a wonderful way to release powerful,
                  positive energy into the universe. Today, utilize your creativity to make a statement about who you are. Act in an unusual way that gets you noticed and offers you an opportunity to let others to learn something about you. Wrap your
                  message in an unexpected package.</p>

                <h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4>
                <p> If you want to get some new energy in your life right now, you need to mix it up with some new people. Makes sense, right? Strike up a conversation with a stranger in line, compliment a rookie co-worker on a new outfit, or ask
                  someone to lunch who you've never really talked to before. Expanding your experiences starts with expanding the people you talk to. You'll be surprised by how much of a difference one little conversation can have on your outlook.

                <p> You're a very generous person, to a fault, sometimes. There are some new people in your life right now who could be angling to take advantage of the fact that you tend to think of the needs of others before you consider your own
                  needs. Today, you should protect yourself. Switch around your priority list to focus more on giving yourself what you need (and keeping what you have). Conservation is a big long word for hanging on to what you've worked so hard
                  for.</p>

                <p> Are you intimidated by anyone right now? If so, you need to spend time with them today. Don't veer into stalker territory, but you should try your best to spend as much time as you can with someone who makes you feel
                  self-conscious or nervous. The more you can see them for who they really are, the less uncomfortable they'll make you feel in the future. If no one intimidates you, then keep an eye out for a shy person who's doing their best to get
                  to know you. Be friendly!</p>

              <section class="horoscope">
                <h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4>
                <p> Today, you could see something odd, but you should understand that it's a clear sign that you're on the right track. Results are piling up left and right, and you need to feel proud of yourself -- even if no one else is patting
                  you on the back. One or two relationships are moving to a deeper level. You might not feel up for the challenge, but you are. Don't fret if people are clamming up or hiding behind their walls. Your patience is all they need.</p>

                <h4 class="grand">Libra</h4>
                <p> Conversations with a few intellectual giants will be entertaining and enriching today, especially if you have confidence in what you bring to the mix. Keep in mind that you don't have to be an expert on everything to be included.
                  In fact, a healthy curiosity will make you a very helpful conversational partner. Check out key concepts and get familiar with them so you'll know what to ask when. Your brain is getting hungry, so feed it before it growls!</p>

                <h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4>
                <p> Your ideas are definitely the best ones being offered up today, so how come no one is listening to you? This is no time to throw a hissy fit out of frustration, because that will do little to help people take you seriously.
                  Instead, resign yourself to the fact that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. In "groupthink" situations, sometimes the answer is not the right answer. It's merely the one that everyone agrees on.<br /></p>

                <h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4>
                <p> Cold logic is for math problems and science fair projects, not for introducing new people into your life! The next time you're thrust into a large social group with little warning, don't put up your guard. Stop trying to size up
                  people before you open up. Walk into the room with your mind and heart wide open. It's time to let your warmth and compassion do the talking. They create and inspire much more interesting conversations than critical thinking ever
                  could.</p>

                <h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4>
                <p> This may sound counterintuitive, but the stars say you should seek out conflict today. You're not one for confrontation, but it's a necessary evil in life and something you would be better off becoming more comfortable with. The
                  future holds some battles for you, and getting practice with the easy skirmishes will help you down the road. You'll always be able to see the problems at hand, but you should develop some more skills for doing something about them.

                <h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4>
                <p> No one is standing in your way anymore. It's just you in charge of your life, and it's time you realized that you have more power now than you've ever had before. This could be a frightening realization for you, but if you're
                  afraid of anything, you should fear inactivity the most. Push forward in a major way in at least one area of your life today. Make a change that you never felt you could make before, and you'll get a taste of what's possible.</p>

                <p> Sometimes, an interruption can be a very good thing. It forces you to pause and take a step off the road you've been traveling on. Yes, it certainly can be annoying to have to stop what you're doing, but you can easily turn a
                  break in the action into a very positive experience. Today, use any downtime you have to double-check the work you've done so far, and don't be afraid to admit that it might be time for you to change course or direction.</p>

                  up with some ideas, whether it's for a dinner party or an overhaul of your guest bathroom.</p>

                <p> Just when you think the world has thrown you to the wolves, you catch a break. Isn't this always how it goes? If you're feeling discouraged about something, just wait it out. The solution or answer will come when you need it.
                  Until then, just have faith life will take care of you.</p>

                  Work on being a better listener.</p>

                <p> Bored? If things are humming along at a monotonous pace, maybe it's time to stop pointing the finger at life and just do something about it. If you're not content where you are, that's on you. Add some new things to your routine.
                  Shake up your schedule. Things are only set in stone if you let them dry out. Keep stirring that cement.</p>

                <p> It's time to have a crystal-clear vision of what you want. If the picture in your head is fuzzy, how do you expect to translate that into reality? Sit down and write out your desires. Heck, draw a picture if you're artistic or cut
                  out pictures from magazines. Get clear about what you want and exactly what it looks like.</p>

                <p> Could your love life use some extra oomph? It's fine to be best friends and roommates, but make sure you keep the romance alive. Schedule some weekend getaways in the coming months. Just having something to look forward to will
                  take the heat up a notch.</p>

                <p> It's time to find the fun in the ordinary. Mundane activities are going to remain that way unless you can find meaning and pleasure in them. Slow down and actually enjoy that cup of coffee. Take a long lunch to break up the
                  workday while chatting with a friend. Slow down and enjoy life instead of just letting it happen to you.</p>

                <p> Independence in relationships can be a tricky thing. You want to be part of a couple, but you also want your freedom. Have you been struggling with this lately? If it makes sense, maybe you should set up a schedule for yourself.
                  Two days a week for you, five with your partner, or something like that. Knowing you have the time you need for yourself could help with the anxiety about being smothered.</p>

                  go or cut some things out of your schedule. Keep your eye on the prize. This one is worth the added effort.</p>
