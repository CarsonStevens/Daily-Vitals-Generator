And while this day may test your flexibility and patience, it will still be quite enjoyable. You like it when things are interesting, and unpredictability is part of the price you pay for "interesting." One of your friends might have an intriguing opportunity for you, but you need to have them explain things in more detail before you say yes.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> You could be on a somewhat solid financial footing right now, although it wouldn't hurt to have a few more coins in your coffers. Put a little more effort into conserving more of your funds. The easiest way to do that is to cut out any luxury treats. Drink tea instead some fancy coffee. And don't leave your credit cards near your computer. You'll be less likely to succumb to that must-have item you see online.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> You know some pretty fascinating people, but you may not have seen them in a while. Why not try to figure out a way to get together online? Enjoy a virtual happy hour or meal, sing some tunes, or engage in an impromptu workout and encourage one another. There are lots of ways to stay connected if you use that creative brain of yours!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> No one sees things quite like you do, and more and more people are starting to enjoy your take on the world. Some of your ideas might leak out in an unconscious act on your part, and it might make you nervous. But even if you aren't quite ready for people to know about them, you could be pleasantly surprised by the fact that these people really dig your ideas! Get used to getting more attention, because what starts today won't end any time soon.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> It's time to get social! You put lots of effort into your professional life, and now you need to start putting just as much effort into your personal life, too. Your mission is to accept any and all invitations you get without hesitation, no matter how unexciting they might sound. You are definitely one of the celebrities in your social circle right now, so you need to take advantage of the spotlight while you have it. You can have fun with your people and relax for a while even if you're not all in the same place!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> Are you looking forward to being able to traveling again? You should be! Stay optimistic about the current situation and don't worry about all the details yet. You'll to be exposed to a lot of new things that will amuse you, shock you, and, most of all, educate you! So you'll want to take notes and lots of pictures. You'll want to remember your trip for a long time, so start planning it!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> You could feel a magnetic pull toward a person you've never met before. Resist the urge to cyber-stalk this person, but do keep an eye on them. There is a reason that they interest you, and if you can't figure out what it is, you need to get more information in order to do so. You've been waiting for someone to show you a better way of being with people. Could this be that someone? It might take time to determine this, but you should look for the answer.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> There's no sense in hurrying to get things done today. It will only result in you wasting your energy. Sometimes it's easy to confuse being busy with getting things accomplished, but you need to keep your focus on what needs to happen today, not on what you would like to have happen tomorrow. Let that take care of itself. Try to work on the social aspect of your life a little bit more intensely. There are goals that you haven't met yet.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> Fire up your laptop and start a spreadsheet, because you need to stay on top of all the details that will be flying at you today! You can't afford to let any numbers, names, or dates fall through the cracks. Take nothing for granted. Avoid the gray areas and the maybes. Make people commit to yes or no. Your life needs to be all about black-and-white facts right now. This will enable you to get more focused and reduce the drama in your life.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Even if you don't have a sweetheart right now, this day could be full of romance for you! If you're not going to be falling in love with another person all over again, you'll be falling in love with yourself all over again, which might feel ten times as sweet. You're a wonderful person, and even if there's no one in your life right now to remind you of that fact, you can remind yourself. It's a nice, powerful feeling to tell yourself how special you are.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> Are you getting bored? The best cure for that is to take a few risks! Try to put yourself in a situation where you could be rejected, or at least come out with less than you put in. You shouldn't do anything too silly, like spend your life savings on lottery tickets, but you should do something a little daring. Maybe it's time to call that certain someone, try out a trendy new fashion look, or try your hand at fixing a complicated gourmet dinner.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> Try to use a form of communication that is a little out of the ordinary today. Telephone calls, letters, even e-mails are just so old school! You'll get your message across—whatever it is—a lot more effectively if you use some creativity, especially if you're trying to get your feelings across to a potential new sweetheart. Use beautiful words in a poetic sense to let them see into your heart. Whether you literally write a poem or not is up to you. Just make sure they know how you feel.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand title" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> If you want something done today, you're going to have to work with a team. You might be able to handle things alone, but there's nothing wrong with getting a second (or third or fourth) opinion from the people you work or live with. Bounce ideas off your posse and come up with a solution that everyone is happy with.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> If you want something, all you need to do is ask. A brilliant business idea could get off the ground if you just approach the right person. Things can play out the way you want if you're willing to get your hands dirty. Don't be afraid to invest some time and energy into something small. It has the potential to grow.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> Someone close to you might ask for guidance today, so be prepared to give your best inspirational speech. You have a knack for being a good listener, and that's why this person is seeking you out. Sure, you might not have the perfect solution or the right answer, but just lending a sympathetic ear could be enough.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> Is there something weighing on your mind? You don't need to make things more complicated than they already are, so just be honest and direct in your communication today. No more holding back. If you have something on the tip of your tongue, out with it already.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> What are your short-term goals? It's the perfect day to reassess and make sure you're on track. It might even be time to look for a consultant, mentor, or career counselor to help you clarify what you want to do by the end of six months or a year. As long as you have a clear picture of where you're headed, you have the green light to take the plunge.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> You're in the mood for comfort and ease today. Spend some quality time with the one you love doing something you both can enjoy. A comforting dinner? A feel-good movie marathon? An in-home wine tasting? Whatever your fancy, slow down and just enjoy the moment. Life is pretty good.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> Put on your finest—you could be doing some schmoozing today, even if it is online. You've got a knack for diplomacy in the workplace, so rub virtual elbows with those muckety-mucks and make yourself look like someone awesome—because you are!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> Are the lines a bit blurry when it comes to one of your relationships? A platonic friend might express more than friendly feelings for you, or perhaps you're feeling that a work relationship has gotten a little too personal. Whatever the case, make sure you're comfortable with where things are headed.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> There's nothing nobler about you than your generosity. However, lately you might be only looking out for number one. Today, if a friend or colleague needs your help, give it freely. It will help you maintain your stellar reputation, and you may even be rewarded in some way.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> Bring a smile to everything you say today. Even if you're in some serious negotiations or intense personal conversations, you can add a lighthearted note to the whole interaction just by being positive and warm. At the very least, a good joke can help ease the tension and bring everyone back down to earth.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Make no mistake about it—people are looking at you for leadership right now. Go ahead and step up to the plate. You might not want all the responsibility that comes with it, but there's something right about this role. It's a niche made just for you, so accept it and honor it. You already know what to do.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> Before you call everyone on your contact list, think about who you'd really like to talk to. Some personalities might be too overwhelming now, so stick with close friends. It's nice to be able to chat with someone who knows the real you. </p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h3 class="grand title" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h3><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>Large boat suggestion</li><li>Professional enemy</li><li>Beach front, growl</li><li>Syrup collector</li><li>Pastel red kitchen basin</li><li>Large palm</li><li>Acquire a sore</li><li>Media anxiety</li><li>Sharp speech impediment</li><li>Sharp speech impediment</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>Hair - A Brain - An Ocean</li><li>A Bride & Groom - A Boat & Trailer - A Horse & Buggy</li><li>A Scale - A Tire - A Checkbook</li><li>An Aquarium - An Army - A Car</li><li>A Sports Page - A Movie - A Broadway Musical</li><li>A Cook - A Toilet - College Football</li><li>A Doughnut - A Cavity - A Prescription</li><li>A Coal Miner - A Dentist - A Guitar Player</li><li>A Male Goat - A Dollar - A Male Rabbit</li><li>A Doctor - A Mailman - Domino's</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Aim Hiker Owes Cope</li><li>Aim Honey Bag Care Runt He</li><li>Aim Other Ranch Howled</li><li>Aim Us Key Tub Height</li><li>Aim Who Very Vi</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" class="no-filter" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable60.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand title" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section class="hider">Show Answers!</section><section class="hidden"><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Ship Tip</li><li>Pro Foe</li><li>Shore Roar</li><li>Sap Trap</li><li>Pink Sink</li><li>Grand Hand</li><li>Gain Pain</li><li>Press Stress</li><li>Crisp Lisp</li><li>Crisp Lisp</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>they have waves</li><li>they are hitched</li><li>they are balanced</li><li>they have tanks</li><li>they have scores</li><li>they have bowls</li><li>they are filled</li><li>they have picks</li><li>they are bucks</li><li>they delive</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>A Microscope</li><li>A Money Back Guarantee</li><li>A Mother and Child</li><li>A Mosquito Bite</li><li>A Movie Revie</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Think Twice About It</li><li>Walk on Water</li><li>Space Invaders</li><li>You Are Always on my Mind</li><li>Keep on Smiling</li><li>It Doesn't Add Up</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>The letter 'r'.</p></section></section></section><footer><p>Information Scraped from: <a href="https://www.riddles.com/riddle-of-the-day">riddles.com</a>, <a href="https://www.onthisday.com/">onthisday.com</a>, <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quote_of_the_day">brainyquote.com</a>, <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/what-is-today/">nationaltoday.com</a>, <a href="https://weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/l/8cd1a4fdf1a3fddbdd025b0f20f49602aa7fc5b410cf85c2866e485bd1e375e4">weather.com</a>, <a href="https://www.astrology.com/">astrology.com<a>, <a href="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com">thinkablepuzzles.com</a></p></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='javascript/darktoggle.js') }}"></script></body></html>
