These individuals really like to live beyond their means. Be careful of them. Spend too much time with them (especially socially), and you'll start to feel like you're missing out if you're not constantly spending. All of this luxury can be tempting, but it's not something you can comfortably afford right now. Step back and try and stay grounded. Remember that debt is neither a sign of success nor sexy.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> Even astronauts have to come back down to earth in order to live a normal life, so what are you doing with your head still up in the clouds? It's good to have lofty ambitions, and it's wonderful to daydream every once in a while, but it's time that you rejoined the reality-based community. Right now, being grounded is the only thing that will enable you to connect with other people. And that's what it will take to build that new relationship you want so badly.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> Sometimes it's hard for you to hear the truth. Then again, sometimes (like today), it's even harder for you to tell someone else the truth! But honesty is essential, especially in this relationship. Buck up and do what needs to be done. Whenever a difficult conversation needs to happen, a face-to-face conversation is required. You can't deliver bad news in an e-mail. It will only add salt to whatever wound your words might inflict.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> A friend or co-worker has been acting out of character lately, swinging from one emotional extreme to another. Their unpredictable behavior is causing some waves in your placid life, and you can expect the waves to just get bigger today. It's in your best interests to speak up and let them know that while you understand things might be hard for them right now, they can't expect you to suffer, too. Let them know that you'll meet them halfway, but that things need to change soon.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> No matter where you go or who you talk to today, you're sure to make a very good impression on all the right people. This is a great time to move your social life into more exotic and stimulating territory. Are you ready to meet some fabulous new people? Sure, you might be perfectly happy with the people in your life right now, but a stranger on the scene has some interesting skills to teach you. You should definitely let them share what they know.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> The best thing for your ego right now is honest, old-fashioned hard work. Roll up your sleeves and get started doing something that enables you to see real progress by the end of the day. Create something concrete, and challenge yourself to finish it by this evening. Whether you head into the kitchen to bake a batch of chocolate chip cookies or build yourself a new bookshelf, completing a project will make your self-esteem skyrocket. You'll feel like a rock star.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> When other people are unsure about how to proceed with a challenging task today, you'll know exactly what to do. The only real challenge for you will be to get people to listen to what you have to say! It's time to stop speaking in hushed tones and start barking like the big dog you are. Watch out for people who are trying to quiet you down. They're just afraid that you'll show them up. Don't let their insecurities stop you from making a major power play.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> If you have an ambitious project lined up, today is the perfect day to get started on it. Right now, even the toughest tasks will be as easy as pie for you. An early success will buoy you to keep going through the tougher times that might be coming down the line. Despite all the hard work and sacrifice that you'll need to put into this thing, you should have confidence about what's in store. This will be a good thing for you and the people you love.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> An unexpected invitation might be too good to pass up, so don't let the potential price tag associated with it keep you from saying "yes, yes, yes!" Just because you might be pinching your pennies right now doesn't mean that you can't afford to splurge a little bit, especially in this situation. Go for it and commit fully. Don't try to slide by on the cheap. You'll only annoy others and deprive yourself of the whole experience. Go with an "in for a penny, in for a pound" attitude.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Some days fly by in what feels like ten minutes, while others drag on in a seemingly endless test of your stamina. Which category will today end up falling into? Well, it could certainly prove to be a bit of an endurance test. Luckily, you'll have plenty to keep you busy. You won't be watching the clock and wondering when quitting time is. Consider yourself lucky that you'll be able to stay active and engaged. That's not the case for everyone.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> Are you trying to make a decision? If it's taking too long for your liking, or if other people are pushing you to hurry up already, then you have to do what it takes to figure things out today. First, stop trying to see things so completely. Narrow your focus! You can't explore all ways of doing something. You have to pick just a few possibilities and flesh them out in your mind. Give up on the idea that the perfect answer is out there, because it's not. Close enough is good enough.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> Everyone and their brother has a tip for you today! Co-workers who've been there before, friends in high places, family members who worry about you, even strangers who are just busybodies, all of them think that they know what you should do with your life. The only trouble is, you haven't asked any of them for their advice! Try to see their meddlesome ways as a sign that you matter in other people's lives. They want you to be happy, which is more flattering than annoying.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> Does it feel like you're handling things all on your own lately? If you need some advice from a trusted colleague or friend, don't be afraid to ask. Just don't burden this person. Calmly asking for help is one thing, but breaking down into a fit of hysteria probably won't get you what you want. How could this stress be prevented in the future? Don't take on more than you can handle.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> Are you trying to control someone or something in your life to the point you're driving yourself mad? If you can't trust the process, you're in for some huge lessons about cooperation and teamwork. Remember, you're just a player in the game of life. You probably don't call all the shots, even if you'd like to believe you do. Release that iron grip. Everything will work out the way it's supposed to.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> There's not much that can stand between you and your goals today except naysayers in the office or friends who just want to be negative about everything. Don't let people drag you down. You know what you're capable of and have the track record to prove it. Focus on past successes to help propel you toward future ones.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> Are you constantly thinking about what's next? With that kind of attitude, you might wake up one day and realize you've missed out on your entire life. Stop for a moment and be grateful for where you are. This doesn't mean you can't keep striving for more, but remember that it's not a race.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> Good thing you'll have a lot of energy today, because you're bound to be in demand. But before you sign up for every activity on the board, think about prioritizing. Some people, meetings, or projects will just have to wait. Don't let this stress you out. You need to do what's best for you. That's the bottom line.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> There are easy ways to start making your life more healthy. You just have to implement them. If you feel like you need an overhaul, do a few of the following: Get a bike and start riding to work (or at least to the grocery store), swap out your toxic cleaning products for eco-friendly ones, and make an effort to start cooking more instead of wasting money and plastic packaging on fast food.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> Before diving right in, think about the ramifications of entirely changing your environment, circumstances, or whatever other aspect of your life you're thinking of turning upside down. It may not be worth the plunge. How will you feel a week from now? If you can't picture yourself totally happy and confident about the future, maybe you should reconsider.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> You've spent the last few months growing an audience. Now it's time to cash in on that! People who trust your opinions or fans of your work are more than willing to buy what you're selling. Start developing a product or service. Once it's finally ready to launch, it will be like taking candy from a baby.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> So you didn't get the immediate results you were hoping for? No worries. Deep down, you probably knew this was a possibility. Keep at it. Rome wasn't built in a day, and you can't expect instant fulfillment of your desires. Just come up with a sound plan, devote a little time each day or week to the process, and before you know it you'll be exactly where you need to be.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> After the completion of a big project, the end of an era, or getting to the finish line of something in your life, there's the thrill of achievement. But then there's the letdown. "Now what?" you might be thinking. Well, now it's time for the next project, chapter, or race. What skills do you have now that you learned from last time? Time to improve your score.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Sometimes life will clobber you over the head with something until you finally get it through your thick skull. What lesson keeps popping up in your world that you're just refusing to learn? No, this isn't a coincidence. It's an opportunity to learn. If you keep throwing it away, you're missing the whole point of living.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> A lot of people give lip service to the idea of slowing down and enjoying life. But it's not just a good idea in theory. If you're starting to feel like a cog in the wheel, take a long time-out and reconnect with your greater purpose here on earth. What were you born to do? What makes you happy? If you don't already know the answers to these questions, it's time to find them.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4 class="grand" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h4><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>lucrative, deadly</li><li>elect, accomplished</li><li>deportation, cellar</li><li>indecision, confidence</li><li>accommodate, cease</li><li>influential, dominant</li><li>rigorous, defective</li><li>banish, chasm</li><li>forlorn, beside</li><li>inadequate, altruistic</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>Green - Moola - Dough</li><li>Playing - Time - Greeting</li><li>Punch - Hair - A Volleyball</li><li>High - Balance - Laser</li><li>Human - Rat - Relay</li><li>Cat - Dog - Gold</li><li>Toad - Foot - Bar</li><li>French - Eskimo - Hershey</li><li>Area - Fire - Zip</li><li>Gray - Red - Timber</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>js?d=1227";
