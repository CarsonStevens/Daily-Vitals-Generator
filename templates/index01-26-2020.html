You need to prioritize. Take stock of your activities in order to figure out what responsibilities you can toss. First, figure out how much time you spend thinking about what you're going to do. Then, figure out how much time you spend actually doing things. Tasks that require the most action should rise to the top of your to-do list.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> You're intelligent enough to know that all that glitters is not gold, but today it will be easier than ever to see the truth behind people's false fronts. Some of the smokescreens people are putting up might be little more than white lies, silly attempts to make themselves look better in your eyes. But some people are seriously trying to make you believe something that just isn't true. Don't let them get away with it! Call them on it. You can't win by playing their game.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> You have come to your opinions through your own life experiences, and you have every right to stand firmly behind them. However, you also have to realize that other people have come to their conclusions through their own legitimate ways. You can't disqualify an opinion just because it doesn't match yours. Don't be too dogmatic in your beliefs. If you close your mind, you'll inevitably shut out some people who could enrich your life in ways you don't yet understand.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> You'll have to do your darndest to keep a private problem from spilling out into a public forum today. The only thing worse than airing dirty laundry in public is having to listen to every Tom, Dick, and Harry give you advice on what to do about it. If you want to avoid being lectured, you need to avoid sharing your latest drama with anyone except your nearest and dearest friends. Oversharing isn't your style anyway. Right now, you'd just be wiser to keep things closer to your chest.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> Prioritizing having fun over taking on a new responsibility may seem like a big no-no right now, but who says? You need balance in your life. Add some sweet to all the bitter you've been dealing with lately! Move away from the grown-up stuff and get silly instead of serious today. Go out and buy yourself a gift. It doesn't have to be big. It just has to put a smile on your face. An ice cream cone, a new book, or a ticket to a wacky comedy movie might be all it takes.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> You want to get out and go today, but you should be mindful of how other people feel about that idea. The people you usually go on your adventures with could be stressed, and they could be having a hard time stepping out of their tense situations in order to join you in all the fun. Despite your best efforts to convince them to relax for a while, they could have some harsh words for you. This is merely misdirected anger, so try not to let it hurt your feelings.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> There is a balance due to you, and it has been due to you for a while. Polite requests haven't worked, and now you might be getting a bit antsy. Before you get really angry with this person, wait a little while longer. The final payment will be made soon, and their apologies for the tardiness will be heartfelt. Remember to be generous with those who were generous with you. Keep on putting out good energy if you want to keep getting it back in return.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> Taking a chance today could yield some interesting results. Risk isn't something you should be at all wary of. In fact, adding a dash of insecurity to your life will also add a bit more excitement. Sitting on the edge of your seat might not be terribly comfortable, but it certainly affords you a better view, doesn't it? Near the end of the day, you will see something that's truly inspiring. It could help you refocus on the next big mountain you want to climb.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> In order to be happy and healthy right now, you need to get a little more discipline going in your life. Letting yourself do whatever you want to do, have whatever you want to have, and say whatever you feel like saying is holding you back. You'll be much better off if you give yourself guidelines. When you stay within those guidelines, you'll be proud of yourself. Challenging yourself is the only way to really impress the person who counts the most: you!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> The rat race isn't very much fun right now, so why do you choose to participate? Free yourself from the expectations of the neighbors and step out of the mainstream. You have the discipline you need to go off on your own and try to build up your ideas without input from anyone else. You don't need instructions from others to know how to run your own life! Being a part of a community is important, but today you should realize that your first priority is you.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> You need to treat the new members of your group or team with extra respect today, because they need to know that they're joining a positive culture, not a negative one. Hazing, intimidating, or initiating new people is a waste of energy and counterproductive. It will only make it even more difficult for everyone to get along and become a cohesive group. Do what you want to do when someone new walks into the room: Smile, extend your hand, and introduce yourself.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> Unexpected eruptions from annoying people could cause some stress in your day, but if you prepare yourself physically and mentally, you can avoid the brunt of the drama. Just assume that others are going to have different opinions. Then, when it happens, you won't get all riled up. And if it doesn't happen, you're still set. It's not about assuming the worst. It's about being prepared for the worst. Your positive attitude isn't going anywhere. Don't worry!</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> Your personal money matters could cause you some headaches, especially since finances aren't favored today. Your body could suffer if you've been neglecting your fitness program, especially your joints and muscles.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> It could be a difficult day at work for you. If you try to take shortcuts or avoid duties, you may be stressed. This definitely isn't a good day to travel. You might want to do some leisurely activity at home and go to bed early. Get plenty of rest. Tomorrow should be a more favorable day for you.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> Your job should be going rather well unless you're distracted by love or relationship issues. When it comes to your money, avoid being overly optimistic on your long-term financial projections. Do some research and get real-world numbers.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> Neither ecstatic nor unhappy, you'll probably experience a sensation of easy sailing at this point in your life. Your financial situation likely feels quite secure, even if you're not making remarkable profits in any business ventures. Take this opportunity to enjoy your stability and plan for the future.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> When it comes to your romantic relationships, it might be best to stay grounded rather than get caught up in some delusion. You could also be in somewhat of a financial pickle. To keep from getting further into debt, try coming up with a workable monthly budget.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> Your workplace could be very busy and hectic today, especially if you work in manufacturing. Your friendships could be bothersome today, because friends could make some unrealistic demands on your time.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> It's a great day to socialize. Squeeze in some gossip at your coffee break, go to lunch with co-workers, and take the family out for pizza. You might need to take a little rest and then spend some time with your partner. Everything should be smooth sailing on the sea of romance.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> If you're in a romantic relationship, the flames of passion are getting white hot. Practice a little self-control to keep from going overboard. Your financial situation shows signs of improvement, but just remember to stick to your budget.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> If you've been finding it hard to sleep at night, try to get yourself into a peaceful state of mind before bedtime. At home, you may sense some hostility from some family members. Keep on an even keel and just go about your day as usual. You're not responsible for others' feelings of inadequacy.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> A domestic crises may be looming. Your "go get em" attitude makes you an effective and natural leader, which might be exactly what your family needs at this time. Now more than ever, acting with discipline and maturity is crucial, as is avoiding distractions and keeping your priorities straight.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Those on the more entrepeneurial side might be seeing quite a bit of business today. While this will undoubtedly be profitable, it may also be rather taxing. Pause for a few minutes every so often to catch your breath, clear your mind, and keep yourself from getting too overwhelmed.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> Family and home are very much in favor today. Travel isn't favored. However, if you do go on a trip, your best bet would be to head either to the mountains or the beach. Spend a portion of your time reflecting on the importance of family and friends in your life.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4 class="grand" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h4><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>lifetime, comply</li><li>obey, accomplished</li><li>ignorant, cultured</li><li>indivisible, irreversible</li><li>side, coincidental</li><li>reception, antithetical</li><li>shame, quotation</li><li>literal, defective</li><li>already, despise</li><li>adroit, obtain</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>A Bull - A Car - A Shoe Salesman</li><li>A Courtroom - A Dugout - A Park</li><li>A Football Team - A Phone - A Stereo</li><li>Yellow - Black - Baltic</li><li>Dark - White - Milk</li><li>Steak - Spaghetti - Tartar</li><li>A Bobbin - Spider Webb - A Screw</li><li>Tow - Row - Show</li><li>Rally - Stock - Drag</li><li>Families - Trees - Hair</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>js?d=1227";
