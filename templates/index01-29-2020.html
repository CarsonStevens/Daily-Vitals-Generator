You're going full-steam ahead, and this person is feeling a little left behind! It will take everything you've got to quit working on what you're obsessed about today, but you need to take a break, at least long enough to give someone in your life the attention they deserve. They have some questions for you, and one or two of them might be uncomfortable. Answer them. You need to prove to this person that they still matter to you.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Taurus</h4><p> Today, when your deep understanding of someone else's pain catches you by surprise, don't be afraid. These sudden, empathetic emotions might take you off guard, but they're wonderful evidence of the amount of love that you have in your heart. Give some of that love away today. Whether you just smile genuinely at a stranger, hug someone who's going through a hard time, or write a long love letter to your partner, you will feel sunny and positive about life.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Gemini</h4><p> You can have a lot of influence over a lot of people today if you want to. Are you ready to step away from the crowd and champion that big issue that no one else wants to deal with? Things need to be brought up in order to be aired out. Discussion is key. Sure, it won't seem like fun to be the person who starts the tough talk, but the person who creates the agenda can influence it, too. You have a vested interest in a certain outcome. Don't feel bad for pushing for what you want.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Cancer</h4><p> If you've been going out a lot lately, consider staying in tonight. Buy yourself a book you've been wanting to read. Rent a movie that will transport you to another world. Conversely, if you've been starring in the role of homebody for weeks, it's time to get out and paint the town red. Take one of your most fantastic friends. The bottom line is that you need to restore balance to your social life. How you relax has got to change. You're leaning too far in one direction or the other.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Leo</h4><p> Don't be too alarmed if some problems you're having at home start to spill over into your social life. No harm will come of it. It's only natural that things that are important to you take center stage, especially when they aren't going quite right. You might be somewhat distracted during the day, but if you just give yourself some time here and there to process what you're going through, you'll feel your enthusiasm and positive thinking building slowly but surely throughout the day.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Virgo</h4><p> Get bolder when it comes to your goals. If you err on the side of brash, you will transform your ambition from its current, 90-pound-weakling state to a healthy, strong, muscle-bound jock of an emotion. Explore things that intimidate you. The sports, careers, books, journeys, and projects that scare you just a little bit are surely the next ones for you to tackle! If you need a kick in the pants to get you going, consult an older relative. They want you to succeed and can help you.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Libra</h4><p> By defending a friend or loved one in public recently, you did more than become their biggest hero. You made quite a big impression on the onlookers, and people are starting to see you in a brand-new light. Therefore, you can expect to be given extra authority in an upcoming situation. Are you ready for it? Like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon. You're about to soar. Your beauty and grace take everyone's breath away. And your strength keeps it all together.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Scorpio</h4><p> Try to expose yourself to new ideas today by interacting with people who don't always agree with you. Meeting up with someone who comes from a different background, culture, or religion will also result in a good learning experience. You need to find out what people with different perspectives think about the issues that you hold near and dear. You could be surprised where you differ. But you'll probably be more surprised by just how often your opinions align!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sagittarius</h4><p> Listen to the conservative voice inside of you today. This is a day to play it safe and hold on tight to the things that are yours. As much as you would like to give your time to others, you need to let them fend for themselves. If you get too involved and help them too much, you will only encourage them to come back to you again and again when the going gets rough. You can't send that message, especially to the people you care about. Be a supportive person, but do not be an enabler.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Capricorn</h4><p> Today is a good day to get in some cleaning, whether that means simply tidying up a dirty room or clearing up a messy misunderstanding between you and a good friend. You have the positive feelings and high energy that the task requires, so you'll enjoy every minute of the effort, especially since you already known how wonderful the results of your efforts will be. Roll up your sleeves and get going on this project as early in the day as you can.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Aquarius</h4><p> You must be incredibly disciplined today, so keep your eye on the ball! There will be a multitude of distractions for you. These could range from some sort of spontaneous party to a nagging sensation that you're forgetting to do something. In order to get things done, you need to stay focused on the task at hand. Once you're focused, you can check out whatever's going on. Don't worry. You will have plenty of free time and an abundance of energy for fun today!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pisces</h4><p> A friend may be experiencing some relationship problems right now, but helping them out is not your obligation. Even if you think you know exactly what they need to do to get out of this mess, bite your tongue and just let them deal with it on their own. There is a lesson here that they need to learn. It will help them grow. Plus, if you get involved, you could end up being the bad guy. There are details you aren't aware of, so just stay out of things.</p></section></section></td><td><section id="chinese"><h3 class="grand" >Chinese Horoscopes</h3><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Ox</h4><p> Sometimes the only way to meet all of your social obligations is to throw a party! That way, you get to see all of your nearest and dearest in one place, no driving around required. Start planning a little get-together for this weekend. It could be the social event of the year!</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Sheep</h4><p> Leaving the door open to an addictive habit or a person who's bad for you will only end in disaster. Shut it firmly and shut it now. If you don't, you might not have the opportunity to do so for quite a while. Make your escape while there's still time. You won't regret it.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rat</h4><p> Do you have some explaining to do? You know you can't just skirt around the issue forever. Fess up if you should. It's only going to get worse if you don't. Be direct, open, and candid about what's going on and what part you play in it. A few apologies can go a long way right now.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Snake</h4><p> Is it possible you've become a little too dependent on the people in your life? Being caring and concerned is one thing, but codependency isn't healthy for anyone. Adapting an style of close but not smothering will work better for everyone involved.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dragon</h4><p> Today, you might start craving more stability and consistency in your love life. No, there's nothing wrong with wanting something so (how do we put this?) mainstream. You're just growing up. Maybe you're finally learning that you don't have to be different in order to be happy. It's okay to fit in.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Tiger</h4><p> You're not in the mood for games today, but you could find yourself playing them anyway. A certain someone wants to call all the shots, and you're not having it. Stand your ground and refuse to participate. Once this person learns that you won't budge, there will be no game left to play.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rabbit</h4><p> Don't waste any time justifying your opinions or feelings. You don't need to stoop to that level. All you need to do is be confident in what you believe and want. If others can't accept that, they're probably not deserving of the pedestals you put them on to begin with.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Horse</h4><p> Before you get what you want, you might have to train people to do things in a certain way. Maybe that's hinting to your spouse what you'd like for your birthday or getting your subordinates to turn in better work. Before you get frustrated that you aren't happy with the output, take the time to show people what would make you happy.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Monkey</h4><p> Are you spending too much time and money on commitments that aren't giving you a good enough return? It's probably time to cut back on some things, and that means letting go of projects, social engagements, or other commitments that take up your time but aren't really worth the effort in the end. Make a list of your activities and cut out at least three today.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Rooster</h4><p> It's time to team up with someone who really complements your skills. Whether this is at work or in love, you need a person who offers what you don't have. If there are things you don't enjoy doing or aren't good at, hire an associate to help lighten the load. If you keep dating a version of yourself, consider dinner with someone totally different. Opposites attract, and for good reason.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Dog</h4><p> Repairing, healing, and creating are the name of the game today. Find new ways to solve your problems, especially those that are emotional in nature. If those vices are getting out of control, it's time to seek help. At the very least, pick up a self-help book and start educating yourself.</p></section><section class="horoscope"><h4 class="grand">Pig</h4><p> An unexpected source of income could start flowing into your life, making things much easier for you. What will you do with the money? Since this good luck will most likely continue, consider spending a bit on yourself. A shopping trip or vacation is probably long overdue.</p></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4 class="grand" style="text-align: center">Word Puzzles</h4><section id="word-puzzles"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="hink-pinks"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol><li>lifetime, comply</li><li>digging, despise</li><li>lend, boarded</li><li>complicity, quotation</li><li>indulge, cease</li><li>careful, defective</li><li>discretion, alarm</li><li>hellish, captivating</li><li>rescind, annihilate</li><li>adopt, accomplished</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="commonyms"><h4 class="grand">Commonyms</h4><ol><li>Wagon - Ferris - Cart</li><li>Love - Chain - Dear John</li><li>Hot - Chili - Corn</li><li>Bricks - Eggs - Carpets</li><li>A Skyscraper - Ernest Heminway - Mark Twain</li><li>Tone - Zest - Dove</li><li>Door - Grand - Nobel</li><li>Pillow - Dog - Fist</li><li>Dinner - Straight - Leather</li><li>Labor - Columbus - Ground Hog</li></ol></section></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><section id="mad-gabs"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol><li>Able Owe Knees Hand Which</li><li>Ace Date Tough Gay Hoss</li><li>Ace Heal Ink Van</li><li>Ace Heck Hunch Ants</li><li>Ace Height Force or Ri</li></ol></section></section></section></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><section id="bamboozables"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><img id="bamboozable-img" src="http://www.thinkablepuzzles.com/bamboozables/bamboozable43.jpg" /></section></td></tr></tbody></table></main><h3 class="grand" id="answer-page">Answers</h3><section id="answers"><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Hink Pinks</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>career, adhere</li><li>bore, abhor</li><li>afford, aboard</li><li>collusion, allusion</li><li>entertain, abstain</li><li>accurate, inaccurate</li><li>attention, apprehension</li><li>horrible, adorable</li><li>abolish, demolish</li><li>accept, adept</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Commonymns</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>wheels</li><li>letters</li><li>types of dogs</li><li>they are laid</li><li>they have stories</li><li>names of soap brands</li><li>prizes</li><li>fights</li><li>jackets</li><li>day</li><ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Mad Gabs</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>A Bologna Sandwich</li><li>A State of Chaos</li><li>A Ceiling Fan</li><li>A Second Chance</li><li>A Sight for Sore Eye</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Bamboozables</h4><ol class="answer-style"><li>Excuse Me</li><li>Sunny Side Up</li><li>Breaking the Ice</li><li>It Came Upon a Midnight Clear</li><li>I'm Over Worked and Under Paid</li><li>Go in Style</li></ol></section><section class="word-puzzle-wrapper"><h4 class="grand">Riddle</h4><p>An ant-eater!</p></section></section></body></html>
